# AI and ML References Repository

This repository contains code for numerous AI and ML algorithms and might be useful for developers who want to dive into 
this domain or launch an AI project from scratch. Almost every file contains a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm
and references to the external sources with extended information. 

Here is a guide on the content of the repo's folders:

* /assets - a set of dataframe and data sources used across the repo
* /association - examples of popular association algorithms
* /data_analysis - methods used for data analysis (EDA) and preparation of dataframe for different ML tasks
* /deep_learning - a set of Neural networks algorithms (basic, convolutional, autoencoder, LSTM, etc.) done with 
   Tensorflow and Keras
* /generative_ai - examples for LLM, GPT models based on Neural network
* /gradient_boosting - several examples of different ML tasks that use the Gradient boosting as evaluation algorithm
* /imbalanced - algorithms that deals with Imbalanced classes problem (Oversampling, Under-sampling)
* /recommenders - an example of a simple recommender system
* /sklearn - numerous examples of different algorithms and tasks that can accomplished with the SkLearn library
* /time_series - algorithms for dealing with Time Series data
* /unsupervised - examples of unsupervised ML algorithms
* /vision - an example of Digits recognition algorithm
