Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? __eou__ You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . __eou__ What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? __eou__ I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . __eou__ I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . __eou__ That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__ Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__ Good.Let ' s go now . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Can you do push-ups ? __eou__ Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute . __eou__ Really ? I think that's impossible ! __eou__ You mean 30 push-ups ? __eou__ Yeah ! __eou__ It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too . __eou__
Can you study with the radio on ? __eou__ No , I listen to background music . __eou__ What is the difference ? __eou__ The radio has too many comerials . __eou__ That's true , but then you have to buy a record player . __eou__
Are you all right ? __eou__ I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire . __eou__ Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。 __eou__ I see . __eou__
Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . __eou__ What position do you play ? __eou__ I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? Which team ? __eou__ The Rockets . __eou__ Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later . __eou__ All right , see you later . __eou__
Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? __eou__ It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? __eou__ January 5th . __eou__ Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__ That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__ No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . __eou__ Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? __eou__ A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! __eou__
Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ? __eou__ Is he really ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . __eou__ Who is he marring ? __eou__ A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . __eou__ Have they set a date for the wedding ? __eou__ Not yet . __eou__
I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs . __eou__ That ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market . __eou__ What kind of house is it ? __eou__ It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style . __eou__ Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses . __eou__ And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price . __eou__ Great , is it a two bedroom house ? __eou__ No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . __eou__ That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you . __eou__ Yeas , when will you buy a house ? __eou__ Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . __eou__ Right , congratulations . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Hi , Becky , what's up ? __eou__ Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . __eou__ No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . __eou__ It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . __eou__ My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . __eou__ You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? __eou__ We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . __eou__
How are Zina's new programmers working out ? __eou__ I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius . __eou__ So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ? __eou__ It'll be close , but we'll make it . __eou__ Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore . __eou__ And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either . __eou__
Do you like cooking ? __eou__ Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold . __eou__ Why do you like it ? __eou__ I have no idea . I like cooking by myself . I like to taste delicious food . __eou__ That's wonderful ! __eou__ And I love trying new recipes , which I usually test with my friends . You can come , too . __eou__ Really ? I hope I can have a chance to taste it . Don't forget to tell me . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Anyone home ? Jen ! __eou__ I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in ! __eou__ Wow ! You're really working up a storm ! __eou__ I know . I've even worked up a sweat . __eou__ You look like a cooking show host--only messier . __eou__
You look so tan and healthy ! __eou__ Thanks . I just got back from summer camp . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Great . I got to try so many things for the first time . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding . __eou__ I ’ m so jealous . __eou__ The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes ! __eou__
Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? __eou__ It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . __eou__

I don't know how . __eou__ You will . __eou__ Oh ... __eou__
Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . __eou__ Oh where was that ? __eou__ I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . __eou__ Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy.She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . __eou__ Well , it pays off for her.How old is she anyway ? __eou__ She will be 86 next month . __eou__ That is truly amazing ! __eou__

I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . __eou__ I'll certainly try to help you .

I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television . __eou__ Thank you for you help . __eou__
Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? __eou__ Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . __eou__ What ’ s the score ? __eou__ Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . __eou__ So Baltimore is winning ? __eou__ Right . __eou__ This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . __eou__ Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . __eou__ The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia . __eou__ It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . __eou__ Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . __eou__

Every country should face the history . __eou__ Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history . __eou__ Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . __eou__ But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . __eou__ I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . __eou__
Do you like traveling , Kathy ? __eou__ I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... __eou__ Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__

You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser .

I think it goes back about 8 generations so far . __eou__ that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side . __eou__ are you very close to your first-cousins ? __eou__ the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . __eou__ I see . who ’ s the head of your household ? __eou__ it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . __eou__ that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? __eou__ at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . __eou__ that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Wang . Do you feel like going boating with me ? __eou__ Sounds interesting , I haven't gone boating for some time now , and what time ? __eou__ How about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ Sure .

how do you usually get to school ? __eou__ I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? __eou__ I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . __eou__ I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! __eou__ I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . __eou__ cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . __eou__ do you have a car ? __eou__ no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . __eou__ maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . __eou__ you could try . It would save you a lot of money . __eou__ that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . __eou__ if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! __eou__ I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! __eou__ let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . __eou__ sounds good ! Let's go ! __eou__

I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . __eou__
Isn't this lovely weather ?

It's going to rain soon . __eou__ Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! __eou__ But I don't think it's so nice . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . __eou__
On , darn . The grocery store is closed . __eou__ Yeah , this one closes at ten . We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth . __eou__ Alright . We are out of everything . __eou__ I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day . __eou__ I know , our schedules are so weird . Sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ’ s open when we get home . __eou__ Yeah , and the prices there are very high . __eou__ I know . Three dollars for milk . __eou__
Do you think they two will get married ? __eou__ You can count on it . __eou__ I think so.Yes , they get along so well . __eou__ I like him.He ' s good for her . __eou__ You're right . He sure is . __eou__

Then we will visit the University Museum . __eou__ Where are we going to have a drink ? __eou__ There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank . __eou__ Good . I will have hot chocolate . __eou__ A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green . __eou__ When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you . __eou__ Sorry . How far is the museum ? __eou__ I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop . __eou__ Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks . __eou__
How about going to the cinema tonight ? __eou__ That's great . What's on tonight ? __eou__ I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . __eou__ Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . __eou__ Don't you think it's too bloody ? __eou__ On the contrary , very exciting . __eou__
I feel so uncomfortable . __eou__ Are you sick ? __eou__ No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge . __eou__ He ’ ll finish writing in a minute . __eou__
I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo . __eou__ Really ? Are you sure ? __eou__ Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__ Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . __eou__ Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . __eou__ I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . __eou__ Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! __eou__
Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? __eou__ It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . __eou__ Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? __eou__ News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . __eou__ Is there anything interesting ? __eou__ Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . __eou__ I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? __eou__ Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . __eou__ That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? __eou__ Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . __eou__ I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? __eou__ Yes , 50 Yuan per month . __eou__
Oh , no ! __eou__ How dreadful ! __eou__ Look at the view from the window . __eou__ Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected . __eou__ It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed . __eou__ It can ’ t be helped . __eou__
What do you do in your free time , Nancy ? __eou__ Well , I like playing the violin . __eou__ Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ? __eou__ About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school . __eou__ That's really interesting . __eou__ Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though . __eou__ Of course it does . Everybody has his own hobby . __eou__
How can I tell her about this ? __eou__ Don't worry , you'll find a way . __eou__ There is no need to be so frustrated . __eou__ How can you live without job in the future ? __eou__ Don't worry , you'll find a way . __eou__
What sports do you like to play ? __eou__ I like baseball and basketball . __eou__ How about football ? __eou__ In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . __eou__ It's a very popular game in America . __eou__ Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? __eou__ For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . __eou__ Are you a football player ? __eou__ No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . __eou__ What is two hand touch and flag football ? __eou__ Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . __eou__ I see . It's safer then right ? __eou__ Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us . __eou__ I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning . __eou__ Great . __eou__
What upsets you ? __eou__ My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . __eou__ It is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__ I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . __eou__ Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . __eou__ You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . __eou__ No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__ I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . __eou__ I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . __eou__ Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__ I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . __eou__
Are you going to the party on Saturday ? __eou__ I was thinking about it . Are you ? __eou__ Yeah , I heard it's going to be a lot of fun . __eou__ Really ? Well , what time does it start ? __eou__ It starts at 8 __eou__ Well , who all is going to be there ? __eou__ Everyone from school . __eou__ How do you know it's going to be so fun ? __eou__ This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks . __eou__ Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun . __eou__ So am I going to see you at the party ? __eou__ Yeah , I will be there . __eou__
Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades ? __eou__ Step into my office for a moment . What is your concern ? __eou__ Am I failing ? __eou__ Let's go on the computer to see what's up . Do you think you are doing well ? __eou__ I am pretty sure that I am in trouble . __eou__ I can see that you are trying , but where do you think you could improve ? __eou__ I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis . __eou__ Having a regular study routine and following it is very important , right ? __eou__ I'll try ; it's hard ! __eou__ Thanks for stopping by ! __eou__
Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you ! __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
I'll never ever work together with him ! __eou__ What happened ? Quarrel again ? __eou__ Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! __eou__ Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__ What ? What did you buy ? __eou__ It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__ What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ And ? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ And it's a brick ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . __eou__ Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__
Is the clock right ? __eou__ I'm afraid it gains a little . __eou__ By how many minutes ? __eou__ Two . __eou__
Hey , Mary , what's up ? __eou__ Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__ Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ? __eou__ Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . __eou__ It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends . __eou__ Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty . __eou__ I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__ Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . __eou__
What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . __eou__ Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! __eou__ I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . __eou__ A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . __eou__ It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . __eou__ Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . __eou__ Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? __eou__ There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! __eou__ Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? __eou__ Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? __eou__
Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? __eou__ I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning __eou__ Does that mean studying all the time ? __eou__ I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . __eou__ Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . __eou__ You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active . __eou__ Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things . __eou__ You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French . __eou__ Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France . __eou__ Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . __eou__
How old are you ? __eou__ Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ? __eou__ I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th . __eou__ Are you going to have a birthday party ? __eou__ Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . __eou__
It smells like an ashtray in here ! __eou__ Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . __eou__ No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! __eou__ Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . __eou__ I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? __eou__ Fine ! I want a divorce ! __eou__
Why are you shivering ? __eou__ It's freezing . __eou__
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . __eou__ I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . __eou__ How come you think of him that way ? __eou__ Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . __eou__ I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . __eou__ Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? __eou__ Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . __eou__ All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead . __eou__
Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard . __eou__ I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . __eou__
Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? __eou__ Sure , I have . Will you join ? __eou__ I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . __eou__ You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . __eou__ I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . __eou__ No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . __eou__
If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . __eou__ I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . __eou__
hi , Emily , do you know that guy over there ? __eou__ The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily . __eou__ He is cute.What dose he do ? __eou__ I'm not sure , he is a manager I think . __eou__ Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? __eou__ Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . __eou__
You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn ’ t mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
Hi , Nicole . Did you have a good weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I did . But I feel tired today . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country . __eou__ And I bet you studied , too . __eou__ Yeah . I studied on Sunday evening . What about you ? __eou__ Well , I didn't clean the house and I didn't study . I stayed in bed and watched TV . __eou__ That sounds like fun , but did you exercise ? __eou__ Sort of . I played golf on my computer ! __eou__
There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend . __eou__ What's the route ? __eou__ From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank . __eou__ If only I could join it ! __eou__
Excuse me . I'm afraid you're in my seat . You've moved my books . __eou__ Oh , dear . __eou__ You must have realized somebody was here . __eou__ Oh , well , I looked around . There wasn't any other space . I waited a while and nobody came . I'm sorry if I've taken your place . __eou__
What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ How ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
I'm going to Japan this year on vacation . __eou__ Have you ever been to America ? __eou__ No , but I'd really like to . __eou__ You'd like it . __eou__
Hey , Mark , long time no see . __eou__ Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? __eou__ Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . __eou__ I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . __eou__ They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . __eou__ I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? __eou__ Not much . I've got enough city life in Beijing . __eou__ I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . __eou__ Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? __eou__ Yeah , it sure would . __eou__
Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__ Did you have the room checked before we move in ? __eou__ Which room are you in ? __eou__ 1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly , the water doesn ’ t run in the shower . __eou__ I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away . __eou__
Congratulations , Vivian . You won the grand prize , again . __eou__ Isn't it just great ! I just knew I'd win ! __eou__ You did ? How ? Did you wear red underwear again this year ? __eou__ Not only that ! __eou__ Tell me ! Tell me ! What's your secret ? ! __eou__ OK , OK . I'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone ! __eou__ What ? ! You did that ? ? ! ! ! __eou__
We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us . __eou__ I'm very sorry I can't . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business . __eou__
You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? __eou__ Not bad.Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . __eou__ I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . __eou__ I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! __eou__ You know the phrase , the survival the fittest . We have no choices . __eou__ That's right , I have to work hard . __eou__
The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm engaged for the foxtrot.Will the next Walls be all right ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Excuse me , is this seat taken ? __eou__ No , please feel free . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ Do you work in Shanghai ? __eou__ Yes I do . How about you ? __eou__ No , I'm a tourist . This place is amazing ! It's much bigger than I imagined , and much more exciting ! There's so much to see here . __eou__ You can say that again ! It's much more modern than people imagine . Where are you from ? __eou__ Um , well let's see ... I'm from Kansas originally . A much quieter and more peaceful place than here , that's for sure ! __eou__ Uh huh ... __eou__
Look at this headline , Soo Mi . __eou__ Wow ! So many people in the United States get divorced ! __eou__ Is it the same in Korea ? __eou__ I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together . __eou__ Do people get married young ? __eou__ Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 . __eou__ Hmm . Do women usually work after they get married ? __eou__ No , a lot of women stay home and take care of their families . But some work . __eou__
Boy ! What a beauty ! I fall in love with her at the first sight . __eou__ The beauty under the tree ? __eou__ Of course.No girl is more charming . __eou__ She is a young man ! __eou__
Excuse me.Where do I register ? __eou__ Oh , over there in Pacific Pavilion . __eou__ Is that the large , white building ? __eou__ Yeah , that's it . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
How was your education going on in Australia ? __eou__ I'm going to graduate this summer . __eou__ Where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? __eou__ I'm planning to return to China after graduation . __eou__ Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . __eou__ Well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . __eou__ Yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . __eou__
Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . __eou__ I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? __eou__ I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . __eou__ You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? __eou__ Once in a while . __eou__ It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . __eou__ I hope I can practice self-control again . __eou__
What ’ s the plot of your new movie ? __eou__ It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th __eou__ Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . __eou__ I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t no __eou__ Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? __eou__ Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . __eou__ Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? __eou__ I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . __eou__ Thank you very much for doing this interview . __eou__ My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__ Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . __eou__
Who's that old lady trimming the trees ? __eou__ She's my grandma . __eou__ She's looks very healthy.How old is she ? __eou__ 92 . __eou__
Mom . My legs are killing me . __eou__ Hold on . We will be successful right away . __eou__
Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! __eou__ I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! __eou__ Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... __eou__ What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! __eou__
What did you say ? __eou__ I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? __eou__ Well , I feel a little tired . __eou__ Come on ! A little labor , much health . __eou__ Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . __eou__ Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . __eou__ I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? __eou__ I Believe I will . Look for me near the lake . __eou__
Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! __eou__ I know ! Well ... he said I ’ m not pregnant . I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose ... __eou__ Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ? __eou__ Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven . __eou__ I ’ m so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much . __eou__
Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ? __eou__ As long as it doesn't take too long . __eou__ My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him . __eou__ Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ? __eou__ He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't . __eou__ So what's the problem ? __eou__
Mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__ oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? __eou__ he didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__ maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__ oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? __eou__ come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . __eou__ thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . __eou__ that's what friends are for . __eou__
Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? __eou__ It was a nightmare . __eou__ What ’ s up ? __eou__ Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__ Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__ Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__ This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__ I am still waiting for their call . __eou__ Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . __eou__
So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ? __eou__ Yes , The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet . So I'd better not risk it . __eou__ Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while . __eou__ You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit . __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested . __eou__
Which pair of jeans do you like best ? __eou__ I really like the straight legs . __eou__ But they aren't very fashionable . What about these ? __eou__ I don't like the way they sag down . I feel like I have plumber butt in them . __eou__ That's the style ! You just wear boxers . __eou__ What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug ? What then ? __eou__ You're so old fashioned ! Nobody is going to pull down your pants ! __eou__ If you ask me , it's a walking invitation ! __eou__
Hi , Charles . What's the matter ? __eou__ Oh ! ! My car isn't working . I'm waiting for a tow-truck . __eou__ Do you have a ride home ? __eou__ Yes , my wife is coming to get me . __eou__ That's good . Do you live near here ? __eou__ No , we live in the suburbs . What about you ? __eou__ I live downtown , with my parents . __eou__ Do you have a car ? __eou__ I don't need a car . I walk to work . __eou__ You're lucky ! __eou__
Happy anniversary , sweetheart ! __eou__ Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers ! __eou__ I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering . __eou__ Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing . __eou__ That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song . __eou__ I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ? __eou__ Always . __eou__
What do you plan to do for your birthday ? __eou__ I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . __eou__ How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it . __eou__ OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . __eou__
How about seconds , Victor ? __eou__ No.thanks . I'm full . __eou__
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Let's say about 6:00 ? __eou__ That's OK with me . __eou__
Cigarette ? __eou__ Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ? __eou__ Sorry , here . __eou__ Thanks . Lovely day . Pity I ’ m on duty . __eou__ I ’ ll stand in with you if you like . I ’ Ve got nothing else to do . __eou__ Oh , no . I couldn ’ t possibly . __eou__
Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ? __eou__ Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour . __eou__ Well , Rose . __eou__ Is there something any need ? __eou__ Are your free this weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I have nothing to do . __eou__ Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__ I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat . __eou__ Really ? well , ok , you're welcome . __eou__ Is 5 PM . Saturday a good time for you ? __eou__ Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . __eou__ Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . __eou__ OK . Then I'll be expecting you . __eou__ I'll be there on time . __eou__
How do you shoot pool ? __eou__ You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball . __eou__ And ? __eou__ You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets . __eou__ How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ? __eou__ At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set . __eou__ Can I get the black ball in ? __eou__ The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets . __eou__ Let's go and try now ! __eou__
How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight ? __eou__ I'd enjoy that . __eou__ I'll pick you up around 8: 00 . __eou__ OK . I'll see you then . __eou__
The mosquitos are biting me ! __eou__ Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . __eou__ Do you have any bug spray ? __eou__ No , I forgot to buy some . __eou__ Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . __eou__ We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . __eou__ That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! __eou__ Run ! They are thirsty for more ! __eou__
Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don't you just sit and watch ? __eou__ I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . __eou__ Then stay away . No one is keeping you from doing that . __eou__ Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . __eou__ All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . __eou__ Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . __eou__ That's exactly what I want , thank you . __eou__
Okay , can I ask you something direct ? __eou__ Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . __eou__ Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? __eou__ No , seriously . . . I really want this . __eou__ I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . __eou__ I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay . __eou__ It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do . __eou__ But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ? __eou__ It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment . __eou__ What time is the right moment ? __eou__ Let the universe find us instead of forcing love . We prefer natural love . The most important thing is to be happy . Love will find us later . That is what we say . __eou__
Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . __eou__ Yes , of course.It was nice to see you . __eou__ It was nice to see you , too.And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . __eou__
Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? __eou__ I'm afraid so . __eou__
What do you think of the coming match ? __eou__ Winning is a piece of cake to me . __eou__ You are bragging again . __eou__
What would you reckon the taxing increases ? __eou__ Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . __eou__ But what do most people think about it ? __eou__ Ah , it ’ s hard to say . __eou__
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? __eou__ of course . Is the dinner still on ? __eou__ yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . __eou__ we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . __eou__ that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . __eou__ it can't be that bad . __eou__ I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . __eou__ really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__ do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__ ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? __eou__ when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . __eou__ has anything else happened to you ? __eou__ nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . __eou__ well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . __eou__
Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . __eou__ Why doesn't he ask her ? __eou__ He is too scared to ask her . __eou__ He's a chicken guy . __eou__
I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . __eou__ Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . __eou__ If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . __eou__ She is as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? __eou__
Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere . __eou__ Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? __eou__ What ? Beg your pardon . __eou__ John is in prison now.He was copped outstealing . __eou__ I just cann't believe my ears ! __eou__
What do you need ? __eou__ I need to use the Internet . __eou__ You have your library card , right ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ There is a wait right now to use the computers . __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__ Would you please write your name on this list ? __eou__ Then what ? __eou__ I will call you when a computer is free . __eou__ How do I log on to the computer ? __eou__ Use the number on the back of your library card . __eou__ Thanks . I ’ ll be sitting over there . __eou__
What a nice tie you are wearing ! __eou__ Thank you.But does it really look all right ? __eou__ Certainly.It matches your suit perfectly . __eou__ Then does it go well with my sweater ? __eou__ Yes.You look very smart today . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
What do you make of the case ? __eou__ If you ask me , I don ’ t think it ’ s guilty . __eou__ What do you mean by saying so ? __eou__ I mean it ’ s not his fault . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? __eou__ Yes . Don ’ t you think he should be pitied rather than accused ? __eou__
Happy Mother's Day , Mom ! __eou__ Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have ! __eou__ Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . __eou__ I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers . __eou__
I have a real problem when I meet people . __eou__ What is it ? Maybe I can help . __eou__ I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ Do you come from a country where they shake hands ? __eou__ Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time . __eou__ It ’ s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ’ t . __eou__ But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . __eou__ Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do . __eou__ That sounds easy enough . __eou__ Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about . __eou__
Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it . __eou__ Don't worry about it . I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well . __eou__ Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out . __eou__ Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us . __eou__ Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ? __eou__ The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ... __eou__ I would think this was the least they could do . __eou__ In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while . __eou__ Great . I have also been thinking of getting one . Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret ? My birthday is not that far away . __eou__ I can try , but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately . __eou__
Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at . __eou__ Let's go in to wait for them . __eou__ After you . __eou__
When do you usually go to the movies ? __eou__ I usually go in my free time on the weekends . How about you ? __eou__ The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . I like to go to the movies during the week . __eou__ That's true . And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well . __eou__
Are you telling us a lie again ? __eou__ I will be hanged if I lying . __eou__ All right . But what was the trouble ? __eou__ My car run out of petrol . __eou__
I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? __eou__ He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . __eou__ Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte . __eou__ When did you start worrying about your weight ? __eou__ I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ? __eou__ No , Jess , chill out ! __eou__
Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes . __eou__ We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon . __eou__ Two tickets , please . How much are they ? __eou__ Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper . __eou__ Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ’ m tired of heavy drama . __eou__ Are these seats okay ? __eou__ They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn . __eou__
Do you often buy magazines ? __eou__ I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? __eou__ Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . __eou__ Do you have an online edition of that magazine ? __eou__ Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . __eou__ Do you have a subscription ? __eou__ Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ? __eou__ I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . __eou__
Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue . __eou__ It sure is . I'm glad it didn't rain . My name's Mike Gates , by the way . __eou__ Oh , hi ! I'm Barbara Johnson . Nice to meet you . __eou__ I'm sorry . What's your name again ? __eou__ Barbara . But please , just call me Barb . __eou__ So Barb ... what do you do ? __eou__ I'm studying medicine . __eou__ Really ? Where ? __eou__ At Harvard . What about you ? __eou__ I'm an engineer at IBM . __eou__ Oh , are you ? That sounds interesting . __eou__ Yeah . I like it . Hey , it looks like the food is ready . __eou__ Good . I'm starving . __eou__
Wow ! I can't believe I'm standing here ! __eou__ What are you so excited about ? __eou__ I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! __eou__ What's the big deal ? It's just a picture of some woman . __eou__ I've seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person . __eou__ There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . __eou__ Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? __eou__ No , how much is it worth ? __eou__ About 80 million dollars . __eou__ Whoa . __eou__
hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? __eou__ part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? __eou__ oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? __eou__ sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . __eou__ cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! __eou__ yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . __eou__ that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? __eou__ of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . __eou__ you mean you got working experience , right ? __eou__ not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . __eou__ it must be very demanding . __eou__ sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out . __eou__ really ? It sounds interesting . __eou__ maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around . __eou__ great . I ’ m looking forward to it . __eou__
Have you seen that house ? __eou__ Yes , it looks interesting . __eou__ You're right . I love it very much . __eou__ It must be old . __eou__ At least more than 100 years old . __eou__ Let's enter it ! __eou__ I can't open the door . __eou__ It must be locked . __eou__ Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . __eou__ She can't answer you . __eou__ She must be deaf . __eou__ It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking . __eou__
Have you got any hobbies ? __eou__ Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards . __eou__ Which is easier to learn ? __eou__ Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places . __eou__
Jim , how was your weekend ? __eou__ I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there . __eou__ That sounds like a lot of fun . Did you go swimming , too ? __eou__ Sure . I think it ’ s a fantastic place to go . __eou__ I couldn ’ t agree more . That ’ s an ideal place for a vacation . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ I can ’ t wait to go there myself . __eou__
You'd better prepare for the examination . __eou__ I don't think the exam will be very hard . __eou__ You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course . __eou__ Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately . __eou__
It is high time you have a talk with him . That may help clear the mists . __eou__ I did , but he gives me a runaround . __eou__ If I were you , I would put the whole matter on the table . __eou__ But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless . __eou__
What is the correct time , please ? __eou__ It's exactly twelve minutes past seven . __eou__ When will the lecture begin ? __eou__ It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp . __eou__
Should I ask Sara to the party ? __eou__ I would if I were you . __eou__
If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word . __eou__ You said it . I always count on him when I need his help . __eou__ Last year he helped me out of trouble , too . __eou__
We're having a sixties party next week . Do you want to come ? __eou__ What is a sixties party ? __eou__ You come dressed in anything from the sixties . __eou__ That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ? __eou__ Check out your mom's closet . I'll bet she still has something . __eou__ Good idea . Can I bring some music from that period too ? __eou__ That will be great ! Do you have LPs or Cds ? __eou__ Don't tell me you have a record player ! __eou__
I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad . __eou__ Oh , come on . You know it's a long process , you have to be patient . __eou__ I know it , but I don't know when I can make it better . __eou__ A , whatever you do , the most important is perseverance . So you have to hang on there , the longer , the better . Then some day , you will find you've already made a lot of progress . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . I must stop complaining and stick to it every day . __eou__ Yeah ! Where there is a will , there is a way . __eou__
I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! __eou__ My first grandchild . __eou__ And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . __eou__ Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . __eou__ Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . __eou__ Well , children usually resemble their parents . __eou__ It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__
The music has started . __eou__ How do you like this waltz ? __eou__ It's very nice . __eou__ May I ask you for a dance ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ You are doing the waltz wonderfully well . __eou__ Thanks . I'm glad you say so . Oh , the music has stopped . __eou__
Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? __eou__ Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . __eou__ I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? __eou__ Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . __eou__ It must be interesting to study English . __eou__ Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . __eou__ Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? __eou__ Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . __eou__
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__ What is it ? What happened ? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me . __eou__ No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__ I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__ Did he leave when you left ? __eou__ Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ He followed me all the way home ! __eou__ That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__ Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . __eou__ Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__
Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? __eou__ I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? __eou__ I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . __eou__ Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . __eou__ Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__ But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__ I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? __eou__ That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . __eou__ Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? __eou__ Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . __eou__ How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__ That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__ So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? __eou__ Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . __eou__ Why did they want to found a college ? __eou__ Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . __eou__ When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? __eou__ In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . __eou__ It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . __eou__ Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . __eou__ Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . __eou__ I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . __eou__ Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . __eou__ That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . __eou__ You can ask me any question at any time . __eou__
I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? __eou__ Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . __eou__ I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock . __eou__ But I have an appointment with Ann . __eou__ Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . __eou__
What do you do in summer ? __eou__ I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? __eou__ I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . __eou__ What do you do in winter ? __eou__ Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . __eou__ I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer-you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . __eou__ Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! __eou__ Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? __eou__ Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! __eou__
I will never forget Linda . After all , she was my first lover . __eou__ I think you ’ ll lay it to rest with the time flying . __eou__ I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don ’ t want to forget . __eou__ But I think time can change everything . __eou__
Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ What university would you enter ? __eou__ University ? Why ? You asked me last year . __eou__ Oh , I forget.Sorry . __eou__ I went to Harvard University . __eou__ Did you ? And what course did you take there ? __eou__ God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? __eou__ I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . __eou__ I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ? __eou__ Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . __eou__
I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion . __eou__ Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ? __eou__ Yep . And I should start planning now . __eou__ Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions ? __eou__ Just about . There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone . __eou__ How Ay days will the reunion be ? __eou__ Usually it's at least five days and four nights . __eou__ This is going to be a major production for you ! __eou__
Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
What did you think of the film ? __eou__ I liked it . I thought it was great . __eou__ Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? __eou__ Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? __eou__ Not really . I thought it was disappointing . __eou__ It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? __eou__ Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . __eou__
What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . __eou__ Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! __eou__ I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . __eou__ A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . __eou__ It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . __eou__ Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . __eou__ Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? __eou__ There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! __eou__ Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? __eou__ Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? __eou__

Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! __eou__ Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . __eou__ That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , __eou__ That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o __eou__ Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . __eou__ I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . __eou__ Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . __eou__ I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__ Well , there is that , yes . __eou__

I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . __eou__ But it used to be ignored by many people . __eou__ The bright people will remember it forever . __eou__ Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . __eou__

I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power . __eou__ You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ That ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . __eou__
There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street . __eou__ I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish . __eou__ That's right .

He likes children and always wants a child of his own . __eou__ In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . __eou__ Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . __eou__ Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? __eou__

What's your favourite dance ? __eou__ It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . __eou__ How about tango ? __eou__ Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? __eou__ Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped ) __eou__ Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you're right . There needs to be an international response to this problem ? __eou__
I just had a terrible week . __eou__ What a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no ! __eou__
I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! __eou__ My first grandchild . __eou__ And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . __eou__ Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . __eou__ Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . __eou__ Well , children usually resemble their parents . __eou__ It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__
When do you go to bed usually ? __eou__ I go to bed at ten and get up at six . __eou__ That's helpful for your health . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ? __eou__ When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? __eou__ The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . __eou__ That's right . Why do you ask ? __eou__ Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . __eou__ When are getting married ? __eou__ Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . __eou__ Congratulations ! I had no idea . __eou__ Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? __eou__ Do you like amusement parks ? __eou__ For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . __eou__ If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . __eou__ Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? __eou__ Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . __eou__ Thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . __eou__ I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! __eou__
Can you speak French ? __eou__ Yes , I can , but not very well . __eou__ Can you understand your Spanish teacher ? __eou__ More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ? __eou__ About 40 percent , if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast , I can only catch a word here and there . But Mr . Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help , my Chinese is getting better and better e __eou__
you look better today . How did your test go ? __eou__ much better than it did yesterday . __eou__ did you pass ? __eou__ I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy ! __eou__ you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it . __eou__ thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass . __eou__ you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor . __eou__ did you always do well at school ? __eou__ no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams . __eou__ really ? __eou__ sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ? __eou__ I'll get my finals in two months . __eou__ when do you plan on studying for those exams ? __eou__ most students just cram the night forehead . __eou__ do you think that's a good idea ? __eou__ no , I think I should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam . __eou__ that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ? __eou__ I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant . __eou__ it sounds like you've learned something useful this year ! __eou__
Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ? __eou__ Oh , you don't ask much , do you ? __eou__ I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . __eou__ I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . __eou__ That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . __eou__ Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting ! __eou__ Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it . __eou__ Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . __eou__
Do you want to go to the beach tonight ? __eou__ Sure , which beach are we going to ? __eou__ I wanted to go to Malibu beach . __eou__ I like Santa Monica . __eou__ The water there looks so dirty . __eou__ I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica . __eou__ I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night . __eou__ Is Malibu beach nice ? __eou__ It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better . __eou__ So you want to go to Malibu ? __eou__ If that's okay with you . __eou__ Sure , let's go to Malibu . __eou__
There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . __eou__ Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . __eou__ In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food . __eou__ It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . __eou__
Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ? __eou__ I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef . __eou__ You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking ! __eou__ Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it . __eou__ When did you change your mind ? __eou__ After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family . __eou__ I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ? __eou__ Yeah . I went to California to study . __eou__ Really ? How long did you stay there ? __eou__ I was there between 88 and 90 . __eou__ And what did you do after that ? __eou__ Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience . __eou__
Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . __eou__ A house warming party ? __eou__ Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . __eou__ Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . __eou__ Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive . __eou__ I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . __eou__ I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I am trying to find this book . __eou__ What ’ s the problem ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t seem like this library has it . __eou__ Have you checked the computer ? __eou__ I have already . __eou__ What did it say ? __eou__ It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ’ t find it there . __eou__ I can always borrow the book from another library . __eou__ You can do that ? __eou__ I ’ ll make the call and contact you when it gets in . __eou__ That ’ s fantastic . Thank you . __eou__
ABC Rent-a-Car . May I help you ? __eou__ I would like to rent a car . What kind of car do you have ? __eou__ We have Volkswagen , Pinto , Plymouth and Datsun . __eou__ What is the rate ? __eou__ Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen , Pinto and Datsun , and twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth . __eou__ How about mileage and gas ? __eou__ There is no charge for mileage . And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included . __eou__ OK . I'll try a Pinto . I want to rent a car for one week . __eou__ All right , sir . May I have your driver's license ? __eou__ Here you are . __eou__
Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to . __eou__
Which film shall we see ? __eou__ There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? __eou__ Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall . __eou__ Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? __eou__ No , I'm not hungry . __eou__ Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . __eou__
Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , that's true . __eou__ How long is the holiday ? __eou__ It depends.But usually it's about 15 days . __eou__ Do you eat any special food for the festival ? __eou__ Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck . __eou__ That's interesting . I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's really wonderful ! __eou__ Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing . __eou__ I'm sure you'll have a good time . __eou__
I'm really sick of waiting for a bus . __eou__ Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do . __eou__ But a taxi costs too much . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . __eou__ do you have any other symptoms ? __eou__ I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? __eou__ just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? __eou__ yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . __eou__ how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? __eou__ no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . __eou__ how did you get that burn again ? __eou__ I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . __eou__ you haven't had much luck lately , have you ? __eou__ no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . __eou__ when's the last time you took your tablets ? __eou__ I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . __eou__ I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ? __eou__ just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . __eou__ sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ? __eou__ that sounds good . __eou__ soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . __eou__
I haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him . __eou__ Why don't you find someone who is in the know . __eou__ I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . __eou__ Did you ask his former secretary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . __eou__
What are you two doing in here ? __eou__ We heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you . __eou__ I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was . __eou__ Who , Femi ? Yeah , Yi-jun saw her inside . __eou__ All these memories of prom night came back to me . I had to be alone . You remember that night ? __eou__ I remember someone spiked my punch . You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ... __eou__
You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? __eou__ Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . __eou__ With the job ? __eou__ With everything , with everybody , with all this ! __eou__ A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . __eou__ It wasn't always like this , you know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . __eou__ You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . __eou__ Certainly , perhaps . __eou__
Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside . __eou__ Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break . __eou__ Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry . __eou__ Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much . __eou__ My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before . __eou__ Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! __eou__ Well , thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ Oh , don't mention it . __eou__
Dad , what's the date ? __eou__ It's December eighteenth . __eou__ In seven days it will be Christmas Day . __eou__ Yes , I know that . __eou__ So , can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present ? __eou__ Sure , a promise is a promise . __eou__
What happen , John ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ Why do you look unhappy ? __eou__ I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . __eou__
This man is your fiance , Dolly ? __eou__ Yeah , how do you like him ? __eou__ He's handsome . __eou__ Can you give me a touch of his character ? __eou__ He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . __eou__
Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ? __eou__ Don't bother . those are a dime a dozen where we are going . __eou__
Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ? __eou__ No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... __eou__ It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ... __eou__ They're going to give us back the seats ? __eou__ No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... __eou__ Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ? __eou__ You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas . __eou__ Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful ! __eou__
The world changes , the family changes too . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child . __eou__ That is called a nuclear family . __eou__ I don't like such a family . __eou__ What kind of family are you like ? __eou__ I like a family composed of many people . It includes grandparents , parents , aunts and uncles , and children . __eou__ It's a traditional family . It may be too large to live well . __eou__ We can live well , I think . __eou__
What was that all about ? __eou__ We had a difference of opinion . __eou__ Is she going to be okay ? __eou__ She'll be fine . __eou__
Is sailing fun ? __eou__ You bet ! __eou__
John dates her seven times a week . __eou__ Really ? That's a straws in the wind . __eou__ I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . __eou__ Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . __eou__ Right . __eou__
I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me . That's a real let-down . __eou__ I don't think Joe has done such a thing . Don't believe things in haste . __eou__ Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true . __eou__
Good morning , Loans . __eou__ Good morning , Mr . Smith . __eou__ I would like to compliment you on your diligence . __eou__ Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job . __eou__ Yes . And we're proud of you , Loans . __eou__ It's nice of you to say so . __eou__
Which countries have you been to ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada . __eou__ I thought you had been to Australia too . __eou__ No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? __eou__ I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . __eou__ Isn ’ t it really cold there ? __eou__ Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . __eou__
Alison , would you like to have some more ? __eou__ No thanks . I have had enough . __eou__ Actually you haven't have much . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . __eou__ That sounds ridiculous . Why ? __eou__ Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . __eou__
Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . __eou__ Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! __eou__ Thank you , shall I open it now ? __eou__ Yes , please do . __eou__ Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . __eou__ Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__ Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . __eou__
Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ? __eou__ No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ? __eou__ Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics . __eou__ I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market . __eou__ Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents . __eou__
I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . __eou__ I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . __eou__ I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . __eou__ No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party . __eou__ Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like . __eou__ I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . __eou__ I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves . __eou__ Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。 __eou__
Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? __eou__ Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? __eou__ Just as usual , you know . __eou__
Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? __eou__ Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything . __eou__ The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . __eou__ Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! __eou__ I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? __eou__ You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? __eou__ Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . __eou__ Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? __eou__
The weather in Beijing is just beautiful ! __eou__ Autumn is the best season in Beijing , you know . __eou__ Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away . __eou__ What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ? __eou__ Autumn is also very nice in Washington . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter there ? __eou__ No , it isn't . But sometimes it snows a lot in winter . __eou__ Does it rain a lot in summer there ? __eou__ Oh yes ! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing ? __eou__ There's a lot of rain in summer , but it seldom rains in autumn . __eou__ I feel it's rather dry here . __eou__ That's true . Many people from the south don't like the weather here . __eou__ Are you from the south ? __eou__ No , I'm from the north . I was born in Beijing , actually . __eou__ I see.so this is your hometown ? __eou__
Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid ! __eou__ Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ? __eou__ Yes , it is . How do you know that ? __eou__ Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting . __eou__ Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ? __eou__ I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings . __eou__ That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture . __eou__ I love this art exhibition ! __eou__ So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ? __eou__ OK . __eou__
Lousy weather , isn't it ? __eou__ It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder . __eou__ Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves . __eou__ And the streets are covered with snow . __eou__ Do you know what the temperature is today ? __eou__ I missed today's weather forecast over the TV . __eou__ It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery . __eou__ The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports . __eou__ That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow . __eou__
Nick , it's very nice of you to see me off . __eou__ You're welcome . Did you have a good time on this vacation ? __eou__ Very well . If I leave I'll miss you . __eou__ Me too . Please write to me as soon as you get Boston . __eou__ I'm sure and I remembered your phone number . I'll call you . __eou__ OK , they begin to register . __eou__ It's time I left . __eou__ Have a nice journey ! Do give my regards to your parents . __eou__
What are your working hours ? __eou__ Eight to twelve in the morning , two to six in the afternoon . __eou__ Much better than mine . __eou__ What are your hours ? __eou__ Mine aren't fixed . Sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . __eou__
Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ? __eou__ For What ? __eou__ Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . __eou__ Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful . __eou__
Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ? __eou__ I went to Yale University . __eou__ Did you ? And what did you study ? __eou__ I have a B . A . in Economics . __eou__ Would you mind telling me how old you are ? __eou__ I'm twenty-seven . __eou__ And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ? __eou__ Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last years . __eou__ And what was your salary at the bank ? __eou__ I got $ 500 a week . __eou__
Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ I'm all right , thanks . Just a little tired . __eou__ Late night ? __eou__ Yeah , I got home around two . __eou__
I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . __eou__ How did that happen ? __eou__ A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . __eou__ Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . __eou__
What do you do for a living ? __eou__ I ’ m a doctor . __eou__ Really ? Do you like it ? __eou__ Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? __eou__ I ’ m a bus driver . __eou__ Oh , do you enjoy it ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t really like it . It ’ s boring . __eou__
what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! __eou__ that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . __eou__ all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific . __eou__ thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? __eou__ no problem . __eou__ now let's have one together . __eou__ do you know how to set the timer ? __eou__ let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . __eou__ OK , let's have a try . __eou__ cheese ... __eou__ did it come out ? __eou__ yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . __eou__ never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again . __eou__ Ok , let's go . __eou__

I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . __eou__ What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well . __eou__ How did it finish ? __eou__ It finished in a draw . What was the film like ? __eou__ It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first . __eou__ Did your wife enjoy it ? __eou__ No , she didn't . After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book . __eou__

I am sure things will turn note , ok ? __eou__ I am not . she is no picnic . __eou__ Well . if you think I can help , let me know . __eou__ Thanks , Serena . __eou__

What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ? __eou__ Sure.Where would you suggest ? __eou__ How about going to the suburbs ? __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should have told me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I'm telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you'd be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious .

Where's Tom this evening ? __eou__ He's a little sick under the weather . __eou__ Really ! What's the matter with him ? __eou__ He has the flu . __eou__ Tell him I was asking about him . __eou__ I will . __eou__
Maybe you should talk to the teacher . __eou__ No , it's no use . __eou__ You never know unless you try . __eou__ I know . She won't change my grade . __eou__
well , I finished my last final today . __eou__ the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree ! __eou__ do you want to attend the convocation ? __eou__ certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? __eou__ do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? __eou__ oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day . __eou__ no . those you have to provide for yourself . __eou__ what do most of the students do ? __eou__ well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f __eou__ then , I might as well have them made . __eou__ Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty . __eou__ hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin . __eou__ it doesn't matter . Say'cheese ' . __eou__ here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ? __eou__ Certainly . Ok , got you . __eou__
Do you mind if I ask you a question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ What do you do in order to improve your English ? __eou__ I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . __eou__ It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . __eou__
Good morning , Sue . __eou__ Good morning , Tom.How are you ? __eou__ I'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ? __eou__ Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ? __eou__ I am heading for the library .

Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . __eou__ It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . __eou__ What methods do you use to conserve water ? __eou__ Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . __eou__ I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . __eou__
Hurry up . Time is running out . __eou__ I see . I have run as fast as I can . __eou__
Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? __eou__ Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . __eou__ Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this __eou__ Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? __eou__ It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done . __eou__ It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! __eou__ It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b __eou__ Is that better ? __eou__ Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? __eou__ Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . __eou__ That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any __eou__
Can you tell me the time ? __eou__ It's 5:30 by my watch . __eou__ Is your watch right ? __eou__ Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month . __eou__
I heard that you're going on your first date Friday night . __eou__ Are you angry , Lisa ? __eou__ Angry ? Why would I be ? __eou__ Please don't tell my mom . __eou__ Come on . Dating is a part of young people's social life . Besides , you're sixteen already . __eou__ I'm glad that you see it that way . __eou__ Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you . __eou__ Thank you so much , Lisa ! __eou__
Hi , Mary , long time no see . __eou__ I heard through the grapevine that your getting married . __eou__ Yes , next March . __eou__ Congratulations , I hope everything works out . __eou__
Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ? __eou__ I wouldn't say so . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . __eou__
is everything alright ? __eou__ yes , everything is fine . __eou__ what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! __eou__ didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ? __eou__ I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ? __eou__ we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . __eou__ then what ? Your plane was three hours late ! __eou__ we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight . __eou__ turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . __eou__ so where did you land ? __eou__ we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . __eou__ that sounds like a nightmare ! __eou__ it wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . __eou__ have you had anything to eat ? __eou__ I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ? __eou__ I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! __eou__
I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__ That's the most important thing . __eou__ It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . __eou__ Forget about it . __eou__ When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . __eou__ Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . __eou__ I appreciate that , thank you . __eou__
What date is it today ? __eou__ Today is December 23,2002 . __eou__ Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas . __eou__ Merry Christmas to you ! __eou__
Hello ! I'm Penny , I moved here just now . __eou__ Oh , Penny , I'm Leonard , glad to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody . __eou__ It is hard to get used to a new place , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family . __eou__ We'd like to . Can you tell me when we go ? __eou__ About 4 . __eou__ OK . Do you want us to bring something ? __eou__ No , just come here . __eou__ OK , see you later . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . __eou__ Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry . __eou__ Luckily that was nothing serious . __eou__ Thank God ! __eou__
I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida . __eou__ That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there . __eou__ But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin . __eou__ You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer . __eou__ I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it . __eou__ Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother . __eou__ Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me . __eou__ I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old . But perhaps you can keep the article for a while , I may read it later . __eou__
Thanks for coming shopping with me . __eou__ I'm so honored that you thought to ask me . __eou__ I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before . __eou__ You're going to do great . And you're going to look great . __eou__ Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion . __eou__ I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you . __eou__ The question is , can he have it done before Friday ? __eou__ These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask . __eou__
I love slim girls , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Not particularly . I like fat girls . __eou__ And I like a girl with good skin , do you ? __eou__ I can ’ t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners . __eou__ Well , yes . But surely you like a girl with a nice figure . __eou__ Yes . But I like a girl with a nice personality . __eou__ But you like a girl to be rich , surely ? __eou__ Not particularly . I like a girl to be good . __eou__
What's going on here ? __eou__ We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year ! __eou__ Master Li ? Who's that ? __eou__ He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master ! Quick ! Get in line ! __eou__ I will ! I could use some good luck ! __eou__
I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ? __eou__ Yes , I do . The look of a picture is very important . __eou__ I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting ! __eou__ You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose . __eou__ In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . __eou__ Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight ! __eou__
What day is today ? __eou__ It's Thursday , I think . __eou__ Tomorrow is Friday . It's going to be the weekend . __eou__ We're busy on weekdays , but we'll have a good rest at the weekend . __eou__ We'll meet again in a few days . __eou__
I decided to go for this kind of life . __eou__ Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . __eou__ I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . __eou__ Then you will be in line for a doom . __eou__
What day is it today ? __eou__ It's Friday . __eou__
Are you new to this school ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m new . __eou__ Is this your first year in college ? __eou__ I transferred from another school . __eou__ Where did you transfer from ? __eou__ I was at PCC before . __eou__ Why did you transfer ? __eou__ I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough . __eou__ Did you like it at PCC ? __eou__ PCC is an incredible school . __eou__ Well , I wish you luck here . __eou__ I ’ m sure I ’ ll like it here . __eou__
There is something wrong with my girlfriend . __eou__ What's the trouble ? __eou__ The department manager is all over her . He says he loves her . __eou__ What about your friend ? Did she fall for him ? __eou__ Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head . She doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know . __eou__ Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ? __eou__
Are you ready to go to the bank ? __eou__ Sure , what do you need to do there ? __eou__ There ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM . __eou__ I have to exchange some money . __eou__ that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . __eou__ I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . __eou__ I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . __eou__ Their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . __eou__
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . __eou__ would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . __eou__ I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together . __eou__ I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__ People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do . __eou__ I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__ I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__ The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__ Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__ You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! __eou__
Hey Mike . What are you doing ? __eou__ Nothing much . What are you up to ? __eou__ I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately . __eou__ He took the civil service exam and failed . __eou__ That sucks . He must feel depressed . __eou__ Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days . __eou__ Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him . __eou__ That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
Did you hear Peter just retired ? __eou__ Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? __eou__ He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . __eou__ Really ? He looks so young . __eou__
Hello , Steven . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How's your married life ? __eou__ We're happy together now . We both think that we're a well-matched couple . __eou__ That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right . __eou__ The situation differs in person . __eou__
We have waited for a long time . When will we start ? __eou__ Take it easy . I have to cut my losses . __eou__
are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you ! __eou__ I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week . __eou__ Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... __eou__ No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time . __eou__ What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . __eou__ They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . __eou__ That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? __eou__ I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . __eou__ it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! __eou__
The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural ! __eou__ I felt as if I had been in a different world . __eou__ And I was overwhelmed by this scene , too . __eou__
I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening . __eou__ Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ? __eou__ Nonsmoking , please . __eou__ All right . May I have your name ? __eou__ My surname is Gao . __eou__ How do you spell it , sir ? __eou__
OK . Come back into the classroom , class . __eou__ Does the class start again , Mam ? __eou__ Yes , but to the health , this break has long enough . __eou__ Oh , breaktime flies . __eou__ come on , baby . It ’ s time now . __eou__ Mam , another minute , could I ? __eou__ Hurry up , little boy . __eou__
why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up ! __eou__ oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company . __eou__ it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer . __eou__ but my mother won ’ t allow me to accept any part-time job . I ’ m afraid she will say no again . __eou__ why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it . __eou__ she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys . __eou__ that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ? __eou__ I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time . __eou__ I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind . __eou__ I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ? __eou__ just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job . __eou__ do you think it will work ? __eou__ sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try . __eou__ ok , I ’ ll do that . Thank you , Iris . __eou__ sure . Good luck , Maria ! __eou__
Where did you go yesterday ? __eou__ I went to play tennis in the public park . __eou__ How often do you play tennis ? __eou__ Twice a week . How about you ? __eou__ I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . __eou__ What is very difficult to gather team player together . __eou__ I usually play with my school-mates . __eou__ Do you like watching football matches ? __eou__ Yes . I went to Tinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday . __eou__
Why are you all dressed up ? __eou__ I've got a date . __eou__
I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? __eou__ What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . __eou__ Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . __eou__
I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . __eou__ And what did the program say ? __eou__ It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier . __eou__ I think that many physicians now agree with that idea . __eou__ And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . __eou__ And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . __eou__
Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits . __eou__ I was playing a joke on you . __eou__ That ’ s too much . __eou__ Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again . __eou__
Where are you going this weekend ? __eou__ I ’ m going to Hainan . __eou__ Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ? __eou__ Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October . __eou__ I see . What ’ s it like there ? __eou__ Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier ! __eou__ Well , have a great time ! __eou__
Hurry up , Daniel , it's Barbie time . __eou__ All right , Sis ! __eou__ Come on , it's cool outside . __eou__ I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us . __eou__ Hey , Daniel , what's your favorite weather ? Snowy or sunny ? __eou__ Me ? Er , I like hot weather , just like today . __eou__ What ? Are you crazy ? __eou__ I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out . __eou__ Ew , Danny , gross ! __eou__ By the way , what's your favorite weather ? __eou__ I love snowy , because it is very very romantic . __eou__ Look , is that Tom ? __eou__
My girlfriend dumped me . __eou__ Well , that's life . __eou__
Did Roll win the race ? __eou__ Yeah , he did . But he only won it by a hair's breadth . __eou__ But anyway , he won at last . __eou__ Yeah . To win is the most important thing . __eou__
What's this then ? __eou__ It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us . __eou__ But this should have been handed in last Thursday . __eou__ Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . __eou__ Well , what's your excuse then ? __eou__ My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . __eou__ Oh , Yes ? __eou__ It's true , sir . __eou__
Hey , This is your order . __eou__ Are you new here ? I come to this coffeehouse often . But I didn't see you here before . __eou__ Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now . __eou__ Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here ? __eou__ Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English . __eou__ Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ? __eou__ No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . __eou__ Very nice . Thank you for your time . __eou__ Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips . __eou__ OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble . __eou__ Well , would you like something else ? The new-made cafe parfait is really good . Want some ? __eou__ OK . But I'd like some cookies . __eou__ Sure . If you want more coffee , please go over there . There is self-help coffee maker . __eou__ I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here . __eou__ Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly . __eou__ It's OK . Thank you . __eou__
Do you think the bad weather will last long ? __eou__ I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time . __eou__ I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it . __eou__ I think you can go to visit the museum . It's worth seeing . You can go to the square some other time . __eou__ Good idea . Thanks a billion . __eou__
Let's go in . __eou__ After you . __eou__
Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ What university would you enter ? __eou__ University ? Why ? You asked me last year . __eou__ Oh , I forget . Sorry . __eou__ I went to Harvard University . __eou__ Did you ? And what course did you take there ? __eou__ God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? __eou__ I've not known . Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . __eou__ I did a B . A . in economics . Remember ? __eou__ Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . __eou__
I think he deserved his gold . __eou__ Did you see his last dive ? __eou__ Yes , it's perfect ! __eou__ He's diving for the gold . __eou__
You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I have been here for three years . __eou__ Do you like this campus ? __eou__ Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__ Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__ I ’ ll just have to put up with it . __eou__
How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe ! __eou__ Don ’ t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck . __eou__ I agree . Both Joe and Mark are men of guts . __eou__
Hi Mark . __eou__ Hi . __eou__ What are you planning to do today ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet . __eou__ Would you like to have lunch with me ? __eou__ Yes . When ? __eou__ Is 11:30 AM OK ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ? __eou__ I said , 11:30 AM . __eou__ Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ? __eou__ OK , how about 12:30 PM ? __eou__ OK . Where ? __eou__ How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ? __eou__ Oh , Where is that ? __eou__ It's on 7th Street . __eou__ OK , I'll meet you there . __eou__
How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . How about you ? __eou__
Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . __eou__ Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . __eou__ You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? __eou__ Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . __eou__ Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . __eou__ Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . __eou__
I hate to say goodbye , but it's late . __eou__ Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 . __eou__ I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go . __eou__ OK.See you on Today . __eou__ See you on Moday.Have a great weekend . __eou__ You too.Thanks for dropping in . __eou__
Are you really dating with Frank ? __eou__ Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking . __eou__ Then why not keep away from him ? __eou__ The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now . __eou__ That ’ s stupid . __eou__
Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven't seen you for a while . __eou__ I'm fine . I've been out of town . I just got back . __eou__ Where were you ? __eou__ I was in New York for a wedding . __eou__
What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ? __eou__ I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it . __eou__ What do you like best about it ? __eou__ I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart . __eou__ What do you think of the ending ? __eou__ The ending is a bit weak . It's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories . __eou__
Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall . __eou__ Really ? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ You ’ ll exert all your energy and get out of it . __eou__
Is that your phone ? __eou__ Yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? __eou__ It's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? __eou__ Yes , it's got wireless Internet access . __eou__ That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ? __eou__ No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . __eou__ Yes , I guess I should try to use it . __eou__
Good morning , Mary ! __eou__ Good morning , John ! __eou__ I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? __eou__ I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? __eou__ Yes , if that's all right for you . __eou__ I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ? __eou__ Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . __eou__ That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . __eou__
Don't worry . I'm sure you'll do better next time . __eou__ I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition . __eou__ It doesn't matter . Forget it . __eou__ I don't think I performed well . __eou__ Oh ! That's much hetter than I did . __eou__ Can you tell me how to improve myself ? __eou__ There's no secret at all . The only thing for you to do is to practice more . You will succeed . __eou__ Thank you for your encouragement . __eou__ It's a pleasure . Come on . I'm on your side . __eou__
I just dropped in to say goodbye . __eou__ What time are you leaving ? __eou__ I'll leave at 10 o'clock . __eou__ Take care and give my best to you parents . __eou__ Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . __eou__
Come back . You haven't paid yet . __eou__ May , just let him go . __eou__ But he took some newspaper away without paying . __eou__ I know . __eou__ Why ? You make me confused . __eou__ He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . __eou__ Why does he have such a privilege ? __eou__ He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . __eou__ I see . Does he live by himself ? __eou__ Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . __eou__ He must be lonely ? __eou__ I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories . __eou__ How respectable ! __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I need to get on the Internet . __eou__ Do you have your library card with you ? __eou__ Yes , I have it . __eou__ You ’ re going to have to wait for a computer . __eou__ That ’ s okay . __eou__ Please put your name on this list . __eou__ Then what do I need to do ? __eou__ When there is a computer available , I will call you . __eou__ What do I do to log on to the computer ? __eou__ Just type in the number on the back of your library card . __eou__ Okay . Thanks for your help . __eou__
Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane ? __eou__ Yes , I am . When is the wedding ? __eou__ Aug 8 . __eou__ August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ? __eou__ Mrs . White . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago . __eou__ Maybe her uncle will . __eou__ I think so . The wedding will be held at her church , right ? __eou__ Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding . __eou__ Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon ? __eou__ Yes , Jane says they will go to China . __eou__
Don ’ t do that again . You are riding the tiger . __eou__ No problem . I can deal with it well . __eou__ You will ask for it . __eou__ All is best now , isn ’ t it ? __eou__
Hurry up ! Time is money ! __eou__ Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . __eou__ But you are too slow to follow them . __eou__ Don't you see I'm trying my best ? __eou__
Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful . __eou__ Oh no , I won't . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting . __eou__ You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful . __eou__ Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault.If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . __eou__ Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . __eou__
Steve , you look pale . What happened ? __eou__ I didn't sleep a wink last night . __eou__ Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you . __eou__ Well , I am under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me three projects . Now the deadlines are near , and I still have not finished all of my projects . __eou__ Is there anything I can do to help you ? __eou__ Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to , so that I can relieve my stress . __eou__
Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo . __eou__ Sure , When is good time for you ? __eou__ Can you make it on Tuesday ? __eou__ What time do you want me there ? __eou__ Anytime after six will be fine . __eou__ All right , It's a date . __eou__
My friend Jean is very beautiful . __eou__ What's her figure ? __eou__ Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . __eou__ What's the color of her eyes ? __eou__ Dark blue . __eou__
What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ How ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? __eou__ You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . __eou__ Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? __eou__ No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . __eou__ Did you register yet ? __eou__ Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . __eou__ What classes do you think are still open ? __eou__ Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . __eou__ That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . __eou__ I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . __eou__ He does that ? __eou__ I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . __eou__ That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help . __eou__ No problem , man . __eou__
Thanks for helping me move into my new house . __eou__ Any time . I'm just glad I could help . __eou__
I've been so stressed these days . __eou__ What's the matter ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . __eou__ Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide . __eou__ And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family . __eou__ You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college . __eou__ OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? __eou__ In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! __eou__ OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . __eou__ That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ En , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . Second , I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center . __eou__ Is the training center helpful ? __eou__ I think so . Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation . __eou__
I'm glad we live in a small town . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time . __eou__ Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ? __eou__ Yes , we have a big tree this year . I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday . Do you want to come and see it ? __eou__ I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother . __eou__ When can you come ? __eou__ I don't know when I can come . I'll let you know later . __eou__
You know , smoking does do harm to your health . __eou__ Yes , you're right . __eou__ Why don't you try to give it up ? __eou__ I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no good . Smoking relaxes me . __eou__ Have you ever thought of just cutting down ? You could do it gradually . __eou__ Yes , maybe I should have another try . __eou__
Hello , Jim . What was the film like ? __eou__ Awful . It was a complete waste of time . __eou__ Why ? What was it about ? __eou__ It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own . __eou__ A lot of young people have to do that . __eou__ Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired . __eou__ lt sounds like the story of my life . __eou__ Yes , it does , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night . __eou__ I take sleeping pills sometimes . __eou__ Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital . __eou__ It sounds a very depressing film . __eou__ Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end , __eou__ I don't know . My wife used to speak French . I must tell her to brush it up . __eou__
Would you like to stretch your legs ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Let's get a soft drink . __eou__ Do we have enough time ? __eou__ It's a fifteen-minute intermission . __eou__ The seats are excellent . We're right in the center . __eou__ It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . __eou__ I can't agree more . __eou__ Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? __eou__ In the United States , yes . But back in China , I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents . __eou__ Do you have large concert halls in your city ? __eou__ We have two . One is like this one . The other is a little smaller . __eou__ That's great . Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ What time will the library be closing ? __eou__ It closes at six . __eou__ Does it always close at six ? __eou__ No , not every day . __eou__ Will the library be open on Saturday ? __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ What are your hours on Saturday ? __eou__ Saturday ’ s hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night . __eou__ All right .

Whose part do you think is best played ? __eou__ That of the old man . __eou__ You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . __eou__ Some of the scenes moved me into tears . __eou__
Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker . __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ I won't say who , because I'm not sure yet . But I'll know soon . __eou__ Zina , I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad . __eou__ It isn't Elvin . __eou__ Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious . __eou__ Loan me that tape recorder you have . And don't say anything to anyone until I come back . __eou__

What a great weekend that was ! __eou__ My feelings exactly . __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ We should come here more often . __eou__ You are absolutely right . __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend . __eou__ That's exactly the way I feel . __eou__
Aren ’ t you going to swim ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? __eou__ You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ? __eou__ Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now . __eou__ What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ? __eou__ Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit . __eou__ All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming . __eou__ Jim ! __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand . __eou__ I've got a better idea .

That is the new classroom building for our senior high school . __eou__ Is there a swimming pool in your school ? __eou__ Yes . There is a large swimming pool , but it is only available in summer . __eou__ I do envy you . And I hope I can enter your school one day . __eou__ I believe that you can make your dream come true . __eou__
Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? __eou__ I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . __eou__ Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? __eou__ Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . __eou__ Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? __eou__ Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . __eou__ Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? __eou__ Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . __eou__
Don't be shy . Have some more chicken . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__

See you later ! __eou__ See you later ! Drive carefully . __eou__

Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? __eou__ Yes , I am applying on it . __eou__ I wonder if I could enroll in it .

Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ... __eou__ Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . __eou__ You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ... __eou__ Alright ... I get your point . __eou__

We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Why can't we ? __eou__ It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? __eou__ I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill .

Hi Mary , how's it going ? __eou__ Well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . __eou__ Terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . __eou__ Now that I look back at it , it wasn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all . __eou__ That's pretty harsh . __eou__ I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? __eou__ You know she probably feels just as bad . __eou__ Well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . __eou__ Well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . __eou__ Yeah , I'll call later to patch things up . __eou__
I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you . __eou__ Don't do that to me , honey . Give me a chance , please .

Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long . __eou__ Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts . __eou__ That's normal .

He was extremely nervous then . __eou__ He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ? __eou__ Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects . __eou__ That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . __eou__
What did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ What else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ How about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before ! __eou__ To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__
Merry Christmas , Bill ! __eou__ Merry Christmas . Steven ! __eou__ What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas ? __eou__ I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping .

It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! __eou__ Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! __eou__ Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? __eou__ I might just !

Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? __eou__ It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . __eou__ Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . __eou__ You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? __eou__ You can say that . __eou__ But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? __eou__ They must have mixed hackers with crackers . __eou__ What is crackers then ? __eou__ There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . __eou__ So they are two totally different concepts . __eou__ Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . __eou__ I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . __eou__ You got it . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
I don't have my homework today . __eou__ You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened ? __eou__ I was really sick . __eou__ But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ? __eou__ Yes , I probably could . __eou__ You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups ? __eou__ Next class meeting . __eou__ That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ? __eou__ That would work for me . __eou__ Good . I know that you are capable of being an excellent student . __eou__
What are you reading about in that science magazine ? __eou__ There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning . __eou__ I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing . __eou__ According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . __eou__ In the future , that could be possible . __eou__ In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! __eou__ Really ? What else have you discovered ? __eou__ I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune __eou__ That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . __eou__
Thanks for helping me up . __eou__ Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger . __eou__ I'm the hazardous one here .

Everyone's laughing ! __eou__ He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies . __eou__

I waited for a full hour in the cold wind . __eou__ So how long did you stay ? __eou__ I left after the opening dance . I couldn't wait to get out of there . __eou__
What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? __eou__ I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . __eou__ When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? __eou__ Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . __eou__ There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ? __eou__ I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . __eou__ There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? __eou__ I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell . __eou__ You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait . __eou__ If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . __eou__
Where did you go yesterday ? __eou__ I went to play tennis in the public park . __eou__ How often do you play tennis ? __eou__ Twice a week . How about you ? __eou__ I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . __eou__ But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together . __eou__ I usually play with my schoolmates . __eou__ Do you like watching football matches ? __eou__ Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday . __eou__ Oh , I watched it on television . It was an exciting match . __eou__
Where is your native place ? __eou__ My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . __eou__ So are you a local ? __eou__ Yes , I am a local resident . __eou__
What ’ re you doing now ? __eou__ I ’ m watching TV . __eou__ You ’ re supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed . __eou__ I will . __eou__ And don ’ t ever forget it . __eou__

I'd be very willing to help you with that . __eou__ Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship . __eou__ What kind of scholarship is it ? __eou__ It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American . __eou__ Fine . I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher . __eou__ I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 . __eou__ Excellent . So you'll have a good chance of getting it . __eou__ Well , I hope so . The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too . __eou__ Do you have an essay you want to send them ? __eou__ No , they want a special essay . I must write an essay on a particular question they pose . __eou__ What is the question ? __eou__ They give applicants a topic.The topic is , The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society.My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced . __eou__ That's a pretty short essay . __eou__ Yes , but I need to write it by next week . __eou__ Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job . __eou__ I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors . __eou__ Sure . What are they ? __eou__ First , I need a letter of recommendation . __eou__ I'd be happy to write one for you . __eou__ And second ... Well , I'm not sure if it's normal . __eou__ What is it ? Do you want me to read your essay ? __eou__ Yes , if you could . I mean , if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes.Or maybe you'd have some suggestions . __eou__ Of course I could read it . That's no problem . But you need to get it to me soon . __eou__ I will . I want to write the first draft tonight.So I could bring it tomorrow morning . __eou__ Alright . If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning , I can talk with you after class on Friday.So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend . __eou__ That would really help me a lot . I'm very grateful . __eou__ Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students . __eou__
Did you hear how cold it got last night ? __eou__ I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero . __eou__ It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car . __eou__ My car didn't want to start either at first . __eou__ Don't you have a garage ? __eou__ Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot . __eou__ How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero . __eou__ I do . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero . __eou__ Does it ever get that cold on here ? __eou__ Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below . __eou__ Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
What's the matter with you , Paul ? __eou__ I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . __eou__ Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . __eou__ Yeah , I will . __eou__
You look pale today . __eou__ I didn't wear make-up this morning . __eou__ You should do sports to keep young . __eou__ You're right.Make - up can only disguise my age , but exercise may delay it . __eou__

He ’ s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers . __eou__ Well ! I guess people don ’ t find him so peculiar anymore . __eou__

The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night ! __eou__ Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ? __eou__ The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason . __eou__ That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ? __eou__ Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway . __eou__ So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ? __eou__ I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall . __eou__ That's not a problem .

Forget it ! __eou__ But you've been looking for that stamp for years . __eou__ It's not worth it . Besides , I have to save up to pay for some bills . __eou__ Bummer .

I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works . __eou__ Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective . __eou__ Maybe you ’ re right . It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . I ’ d better join in a fitness club . __eou__ You don ’ t need to lose weight , you are not fat . __eou__ I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up . __eou__
I visited the Polar Aquarium today . __eou__ Is it like a zoo of polar animals ? __eou__ Almost .

I want to take my kids there some day . too . __eou__

What ’ s the area of your country ? __eou__ It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers . __eou__ That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ? __eou__ There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . __eou__ What ’ s the average income ? __eou__ That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . __eou__ So your country is fairly rich . __eou__ I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . __eou__ Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . __eou__
Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft . Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ? __eou__ I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself . __eou__ It looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines . __eou__ I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . __eou__ Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food . __eou__ I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home . __eou__
The answer is zero ! What a let-down ! __eou__ I really want to take him over my knee . __eou__ No hard feelings . After all , he is a child . __eou__ If you say so ! __eou__

I didn't realize it . I promise I'll keep it down in the future . __eou__ Oh , it's no problem.It ' s OK.You know , it only happened once . __eou__ I am glad we've straightened everything out . __eou__

I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . __eou__ Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn't ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . __eou__ That's strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it ' Getting to know you more personally ' . What about your answers ? __eou__ Just did my best . __eou__

I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? __eou__ He appeals to the fans thanks to two things __eou__ You mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . __eou__ Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time . __eou__ In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . __eou__ Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . __eou__ And he is English !

Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . __eou__ Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . __eou__ Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . __eou__ When will we get one of those ? __eou__ You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . __eou__
Congratulations ! Mr . Stuart ! You won the city marathon . __eou__ Thank you . I am very excited . __eou__ We are all very proud of you . __eou__ I am very happy , too .

Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale . __eou__ I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese . __eou__ Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well . __eou__ You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress ! __eou__ Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs . __eou__ So you're learning Chinese songs ? __eou__ You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . __eou__ That's a real achievement . How did you do that ? __eou__ I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer . __eou__ It makes sense . __eou__ It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow . __eou__ Can Join you , Katherine ? I do want to have a try . __eou__ Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now . __eou__ Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ? __eou__ Yes , just in case we run into me new characters . __eou__ Ok . I will bring it with me . __eou__
Where to , miss ? __eou__ Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . __eou__ Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? __eou__ From China . __eou__ Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . __eou__ It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . __eou__ Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? __eou__ Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? __eou__ Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! __eou__ Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? __eou__ I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? __eou__ Uh ... yeah .. of course ! __eou__ Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol ! __eou__
Oh , boy , I hate to say this , but I really have to leave now . __eou__ That ’ s all right . I understand . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry . __eou__ That ’ s ok . Don ’ t be sorry . We ’ ll talk later . __eou__
Have you thought of moving at all , Sarah ? __eou__ We ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do . __eou__ Buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ? __eou__ Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . __eou__ Is the house pretty run-down . __eou__ Not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . __eou__ Was it a very old house ? __eou__ It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . __eou__ Is it in a good location ? __eou__ The area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . __eou__
Do Mona and Jim need a new house ? __eou__ No , they have a big new fancy house . __eou__ Does Jim make a lot of money ? __eou__ Yes , he does . He is a science fiction writer . __eou__ Does Jim need to make more money ? __eou__ Afraid so . The more the better . __eou__ What do they need all that money for ? __eou__ Well , they spend it pretty quick . New clothes , new computers and new cars every year . And they ’ Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress , she likes to spend a lot of money . __eou__ Do they have any children ? __eou__ No . They want children but no luck yet . __eou__ What does Jim like to do ? __eou__ Jim likes to travel around the world.That ' s expensive ! So he tries to make a lot of money . __eou__ What does Mona like to do ? __eou__ Oh , she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses , and she has quite a bit of jewelry . __eou__ Wow ... She sounds like a high maintenance wife . __eou__ I guess so . She is also interested in politics . She knows everyone in city government . __eou__ Politics can be an expensive hobby . __eou__ She is pretty serious about it . Her uncle is a mayor . She wants to follow in his footsteps . __eou__ Politics is a hard game to play . __eou__ She might do well . Everyone seems to like her . __eou__
Are you alright , child ? __eou__ Hey , I still know my name . __eou__ What did the nurse say ? __eou__ She said I have a fever but nothing major . __eou__ In that case , you should go home and get plenty of rest . __eou__ What if this small fever turns into a big fever ? __eou__ Then I'll phone our family physician and make an appointment for you . __eou__
Who was the best teacher that you ever had ? __eou__ That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher . __eou__ What was she like ? __eou__ She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her . __eou__ What kind of things did you learn ? __eou__ She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . __eou__ Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? __eou__ If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it . __eou__ You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ? __eou__ She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined . __eou__ I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students . __eou__ Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . __eou__ Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ? __eou__ Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . __eou__ Do you know what she is doing now ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ’ s book . __eou__ Have you ever read one of the books ? __eou__ Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books . __eou__ Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ? __eou__ ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time . __eou__
Mum , this is for you . __eou__ Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ? __eou__ Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum ! __eou__ Oh , thank you.You are so sweet ! __eou__
Did you like the party ? __eou__ Not particularly . I was rather disappointed . __eou__ Why ? What had you expected ? __eou__ I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting . __eou__
Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? __eou__ To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . __eou__ The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . __eou__ Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ? __eou__ Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game . __eou__ Who plays who ? __eou__ Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience . __eou__ It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ? __eou__ In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever . __eou__ I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall . __eou__ Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful . __eou__ I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game . __eou__ Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game . __eou__ That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy . __eou__ Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ? __eou__ You are always so naughty . __eou__
Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? __eou__ I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . __eou__ Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . __eou__
Is that Mr . Green ? __eou__ This is him speaking . __eou__ I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . __eou__ Yes . I am very glad to have the chance . __eou__
I'm so nervous about this oral test . __eou__ Just calm down . I'm sure you'll do well . __eou__ I just want to get it over with . __eou__
I hear you ’ re taking a music class . I didn ’ t know you ’ re interested in it . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m not . I ’ Ve never had a music class before . __eou__ In my opinion , you ’ ll make it . __eou__ You ’ re having me on again . __eou__ No , I ’ m serious . __eou__
What ’ s the date today ? __eou__ December the fifteenth . The day after tomorrow is little Tom ’ s birthday . __eou__ Right . What present should we give him this time ? By the way , how old is he ? __eou__ Thirteen today and tomorrow . Fourteen the day after tomorrow . __eou__ How time flies ! He ’ s a big boy now . __eou__ And don ’ t forget Mary , Tom ’ s twin sister . It ’ s her birthday , too . __eou__ OK . Let ’ s invite all their little friends to come and celebrate . __eou__
Peter and Mary broke up . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__
I had a wonderful evening . __eou__ I did , too.Come and visit us again , will you ? __eou__ I will . __eou__
Do you know Sally ? __eou__ Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . __eou__ Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock . __eou__ Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . __eou__
Do you hear what happened to Sally ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ She had to go to the hospital . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . __eou__ Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! __eou__ Yeah , but that's what she did . __eou__ I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . __eou__ Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . __eou__ True , but there are limits . Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . No one forces them to do this . __eou__
Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? __eou__ I ’ Ve cut it up and come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . __eou__ Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . __eou__ That ’ s why many people look up to him . __eou__
Have you found another job yet , Sally ? __eou__ No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . __eou__ What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . __eou__ You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . __eou__ I know.But I'd like to try.Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . __eou__
Hi . Are you new in this class ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I really don't know anyone . __eou__ My name is Steven . What's your name ? __eou__ My name is Bill . How are your lessons going ? __eou__ Very well . And my favorite subject is Chinese . __eou__ I prefer to learn English . In my opinion , English is easier than Chinese . __eou__ I guess English has fewer characters . __eou__ You are right . __eou__
Robert , this is my friend , Mrs . Smith . __eou__ Hi , Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you too . __eou__ Mrs . Smith , what do you do for work ? __eou__ I'm a doctor . __eou__ Oh . Where do you work ? __eou__ New York University hospital in New York City . What do you do ? __eou__ I'm a teacher . __eou__ What do you teach ? __eou__ I teach English . __eou__ Where ? __eou__ At a high school in New Jersey . __eou__ That's nice . How old are you ? __eou__ I'm 32 . __eou__
Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her . __eou__ I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you . __eou__ She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married . __eou__ Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you . So get out there , Tiger ! __eou__ Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ? __eou__ Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ? __eou__
Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . . __eou__ You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible . __eou__ But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? __eou__ It's once in blue moon . __eou__ What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ? __eou__ The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . __eou__
Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ No , I was out . Was it worth watching ? __eou__ You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero . __eou__ Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? __eou__ Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . __eou__
Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . __eou__ Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . __eou__ What should I do then ? __eou__ I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . __eou__ I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? __eou__ Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! __eou__
How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . __eou__ That ’ s a big family . How old is your brother ? __eou__ Eighteen . __eou__ What about your sister ? __eou__ She ’ s not quite twenty-five . __eou__ Do you miss your family ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Do you often go home ? __eou__ No . But I often send e-mail to them . And make a call to my parents regularly . __eou__ How often do you call to them ? __eou__ Once a week . __eou__
I'm terribly nervous . __eou__ Calm down ! __eou__
What's wrong ? You don't like ancient Egypt ? __eou__ Actually , I don't like history . Lately , these shows are always about the Pyramids . __eou__ The Pyramids are amazing ! Millions of gigantic stones ... each one perfect ... __eou__ And nobody knows who built them , right ? It's a total mystery ! __eou__ You sound like the TV ! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids , are you ? __eou__
What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . __eou__ I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . __eou__ Come on , nothing can be that bad . __eou__ But promise me , you'll keep it a secret . __eou__ Ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? __eou__ I've fallen in love with my boss . __eou__ Really ? Is he married ? __eou__ Bo , of course not . He is still single . __eou__ Then what's your problem ? __eou__ I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . __eou__ Oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . __eou__ Worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . __eou__ Office romance is very tricky . __eou__ It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . __eou__ Cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I want to return this video . __eou__ Is that all you need ? __eou__ I also need to check these books out . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ That ’ s everything . __eou__ I need your library card . __eou__ I have it . Here you go . __eou__ Do you need anything else ? __eou__ That ’ s everything . __eou__ Your books are due back two weeks from today . __eou__ Thank you . Good night . __eou__
Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ? __eou__ I did . Let me go get it for you . Here you go . __eou__ Thanks so much . __eou__ I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . __eou__ I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries . __eou__ So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary ? __eou__ It says that traditionally , give something made of paper . __eou__ I can think of two things made of paper — stationery and money . __eou__
I'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys . __eou__ But you promised to play chess with me this afternoon . __eou__ Yeah , but that was before the guys ask me to join the team . __eou__ So what ? __eou__ You know how much I want to be on the team , and now there is an opening for me.If I don't go to practise today.They ' ll get someone else and I'll miss my chance . __eou__ I don't care about baseball.You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday , and I did . __eou__ I know , and I will . __eou__ When ? __eou__ After baseball practice . __eou__ And then , it'll be dinner time , then homework , and then your Show is on.You are going to break your promise . __eou__ No , I won't . I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you . __eou__ Well , I'd rather do it the way we set up.But if you promise to give me your best game , it's ok with me . __eou__ No problem , I'll play as hard as I can and give you an extra game to say thanks . __eou__
What stresses you out the most ? __eou__ Probably my parents . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married . __eou__ You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents . __eou__ Your parents are not like that ? __eou__ Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much . __eou__ You're lucky . __eou__ What do you do to deal with the stress ? __eou__ Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning . __eou__ That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ? __eou__ Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . __eou__
Tony looks very handsome in the suit . __eou__ He prefers suits to jackets . __eou__ Judge from his look , he's a very serious person . __eou__ As a matter of fact , he is . __eou__
Lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married . __eou__ She must be a good wife . __eou__ Not necessarily . This is only what she says , not what she does . __eou__ I see . __eou__
What's the weather like ? __eou__ I don't know . I just woke up . __eou__ Why don't you look outside ? __eou__ Okay . It looks like rain . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The sky is gray . __eou__ Is it raining right now ? __eou__ No . __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ The street isn't wet . __eou__ I have to go shopping today . __eou__ You'd better take an umbrella . __eou__
Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ? __eou__ Yeah how ’ d you know ? __eou__ You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ? __eou__ Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin . __eou__ It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ? __eou__ Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio . __eou__ In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle . __eou__ Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight ! __eou__ It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... __eou__
I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . __eou__ He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . __eou__ If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . __eou__
Do you like ice skating ? __eou__ I have never tried it . __eou__ Then you've got to try it . Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday . __eou__ Sorry , I don't think I can . __eou__ Friday then . How about it ? __eou__ Friday is great . __eou__ It's settled then . __eou__
Gordon , you're ever so late . __eou__ Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . __eou__ But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . __eou__ Well , I missed several buses . __eou__ How on earth can you miss several buses ? __eou__ I , ah ... , I got have late . __eou__ Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? __eou__ Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ... __eou__ Have you got it now ? __eou__ Yes , I found it again . __eou__ When ? __eou__ This morning . I mean ... __eou__ I am not convinced by your explanation . __eou__
Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it . __eou__ Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week . __eou__ No , we didn't . Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness . __eou__ Right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? Besides , this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen . Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen . __eou__ Oh , yeah , and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie , didn't you ? __eou__ Oh , sure , it was great . I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap . __eou__ It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant . __eou__ That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much . __eou__ And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken . __eou__ But when I pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . I always respect your food preferences . __eou__ Well , I suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat . __eou__ Now you're talking , we can see that love story next time . __eou__
How's your new job going ? __eou__ Really well , thanks . __eou__ How are you finding your new boss ? __eou__ She's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . __eou__ Would you rather have her or your old boss back ? __eou__ She's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . __eou__ How about your new co-workers ? __eou__ They are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . __eou__ Do you miss your old co-workers ? __eou__ Of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . __eou__ Do people in different departments get along with each other ? __eou__ Sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . __eou__ Do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? __eou__ Yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . __eou__ Do you like working in teams ? __eou__ I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . __eou__
Linda , John and I are going to get married next week . __eou__ That's wonderful . Congratulations . __eou__ Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding . __eou__ I'd love to .

I like the striped pattern . __eou__ yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ? __eou__ it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own . __eou__ how about this blue sweater ? __eou__ that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ? __eou__ yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ? __eou__ that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings . __eou__ I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is . __eou__ perfect ! __eou__ you have good fashion sense , Karen . __eou__ thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there . __eou__ yes , but with our sense we'll always look good . __eou__
Susan ? What brings you here today ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . __eou__ Really ? So what ’ s the news ? __eou__ Not too good yet . Better than I was though . __eou__

What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__ It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__ The problem is that many poor people might suffer . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking .

I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . __eou__
Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six . __eou__ In that case , I won't keep you any longer . Drop in any time . __eou__ Ok . Goodbye . __eou__ See you later . __eou__

I think you've helped make a big difference in her life . __eou__ Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ? __eou__ No , why ? __eou__ My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her . __eou__ She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything . __eou__ She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her . __eou__
Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ? __eou__ No thanks . I like to run in the morning .

He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . __eou__ Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . __eou__ Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . __eou__ I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... __eou__ Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one ! __eou__ You are something else you know that ? __eou__

It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday . __eou__ That is the down side of an office romance . I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress . The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case . __eou__ Well , Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work , easier set them done . But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup . __eou__
Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . __eou__ Oh where was that ? __eou__ I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . __eou__ Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . __eou__ Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ? __eou__ She will be 86 next month . __eou__ That is truly amazing ! __eou__
What time shall I pick you up ? __eou__ How about 6:30 ? __eou__ That'll be fine . See you soon . __eou__

Has the train come yet ? __eou__ No , I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages . __eou__ It ’ s so unreliable . I ’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week . __eou__ Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train ! __eou__ Yes , my customers have started to complain too ! __eou__ Oh look ! Here it comes now ! __eou__
I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__ That's the most important thing . __eou__ It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . __eou__ Forget about it . __eou__ When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . __eou__ Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . __eou__ I appreciate that , thank you . __eou__
Jenny is going to marry another man next month . __eou__ Yes , I know . __eou__ But , how can you be so calm . You loved her so much . __eou__ At least I ’ m the one who rates with her . I ’ m glad we can still be friends . __eou__
What's your favorite sport ? __eou__ Basketball , I'm a basketball fan . __eou__
Hello , Jane . What do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ Well , nothing special , reading , watching TV , walking , and so on . __eou__ Don't you have any hobbies , like stamp collecting or things like that ? __eou__ No , I don't have any hobbies . How about you ? __eou__ I like collecting antiques . It's expensive , but it's a lot of fun . __eou__ Really ? How many collections do you have ? __eou__ So far I have more than 500 collections . __eou__ Among those collections , which is the most expensive ? __eou__ A set of ancient china . It is really invaluable . __eou__
It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays . __eou__ Yes . Speaking of digital wares , I bought a digital camera last week . __eou__ Cool ! What brand __eou__ A Sony . It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart . __eou__ What about the quality ? __eou__ Superb ! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear . __eou__
It's four o'clock already . I hate to leave , but I think I must . __eou__ Can you stay a little longer ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but I can't . __eou__
Can I see your parents some time tomorrow ? __eou__ Sorry , they are too busy these days . __eou__ How about this weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__
Happy Thanksgiving ! __eou__ You , too . __eou__ Let's have pumpkin pie . __eou__ It's my favorite . __eou__
Are you going anywhere for your vacation ? __eou__ Yes , we're making plans for a tour . __eou__ That'll be lovely . Where are you going ? __eou__ Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday . __eou__ Well , you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then . __eou__ Oh , we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by . How does it sound , David ? __eou__ It sounds good . You can do a lot of sightseeing , too . __eou__ Yes , we'll take our time . And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street . __eou__ So , you're going to have a really nice vacation . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__

We'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties . __eou__ OK . __eou__ How many courses are there altogether , please ? __eou__ Eight . __eou__ Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner ? __eou__ Sure . The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices . __eou__ Very good . __eou__
Did you watch TV last night , Rose ? __eou__ Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting . __eou__ What was it about ? __eou__ Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it . __eou__ If so , we may live there someday . __eou__ I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ? __eou__ Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists . __eou__ Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job . __eou__
How is your job search going , Janet ? __eou__ I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company . __eou__ Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! __eou__ Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job . __eou__ I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work . __eou__ I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude , my application was accepted . __eou__ Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . __eou__
We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us ? __eou__ I'm very sorry I can't . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business . __eou__
Well , if it isn't the teacher's pet ! __eou__ Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else . __eou__ You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report . __eou__ Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got . __eou__ It just happened to be the highest grade in the class . __eou__ You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it . __eou__ I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade . __eou__ If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it . __eou__
You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ? __eou__ I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word . __eou__ I understand . It's too good to be true , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , too good to be true . __eou__
I was supposed to meet with you at half past one . __eou__ Yes , I see . What did you need to see me about ? __eou__ There's a problem with my schedule . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ Two of my classes occur at the same time . __eou__ Well , I can see that's a problem . __eou__ Is it at all possible for you to fix that error ? __eou__ Yes , I can . Would you still like to have both of these classes ? __eou__ I want to keep both of them , if that's possible . __eou__ Well , let me find you one of these classes on a different day . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
I went bungee jumping yesterday . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__
Hello , Tom , are you free next Sunday ? __eou__ I think so . Why did you ask that ? __eou__ I'm going to have my first baby , so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday . __eou__ Congratulations ! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born ? __eou__ It's the tradition . But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri . __eou__ In any case , I like baby showers , because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world . __eou__ So you will come , won't you ? __eou__ Of course . I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? __eou__ Mumm . no . __eou__ It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . __eou__ I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . __eou__ This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals . __eou__ Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . __eou__ Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good ! __eou__ All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! __eou__ Whatever dude , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . __eou__
We have absolute proof that you committed the crime . __eou__ That's absolutely ridiculous ! __eou__
Where can I get the information , Kate ? __eou__ Ask John . He is sure to know about it . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ He has a finger in the pie . __eou__
That was a tough question . How did you get it right ? __eou__ I just took a shot in the dark . __eou__
There ’ s a letter here for you . __eou__ Let me see it . __eou__ What ’ s the letter about ? __eou__ It ’ s a letter from NYU . __eou__ Tell me what it says ! __eou__ I didn ’ t get in . __eou__ You ’ re lying . __eou__ I ’ m not lying . __eou__ Are you upset ? __eou__ I had high hopes for NYU . __eou__ I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted . __eou__ Hopefully , I ’ ll get accepted to UCLA . __eou__
The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? __eou__ Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . __eou__ Are you sure you can do well this year ? __eou__ I am 100 % certain . __eou__ According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . __eou__ I am sure I can get a 95 this time . __eou__
What ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I forget all about it . __eou__ How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . __eou__ It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . __eou__ I have been looking forward to this performance all month . __eou__ I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . __eou__
Did you hear what happened to Mike last night ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ Well , apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . Typical , isn't it ? __eou__ Oh , no . What kind of trouble ? __eou__ Well , I don't know the details , but ... __eou__
Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! __eou__ Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . __eou__ What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? __eou__ Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . __eou__ Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . __eou__ You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! __eou__
I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing ! __eou__ Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! __eou__
I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive . __eou__ Yes . I dare say it will be . __eou__ It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed . __eou__ No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open . __eou__ But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money . __eou__ Mmm , you may be right . __eou__ Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ? __eou__ No . We couldn ’ t possibly . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ It will be summer . So it will be hot . __eou__ Is that very likely in England ? __eou__ Yes . It could happen . __eou__
Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas . __eou__ What did you have in mind ? __eou__ I don't know yet . __eou__ I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__ I want to give a gift that is really meaningful . __eou__ Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them . __eou__ Or what only we are able to give them . __eou__
Uh ... that's Greek to me . __eou__ That means they have tapered legs . __eou__ Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in . __eou__ Mine are , too . __eou__ So maybe we shouldn't go out after all . __eou__ Yeah . Let's just lounge around ! __eou__
Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ? __eou__ Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me . __eou__ Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb . __eou__ Uh , A ... you know I'm friends with William . __eou__ Oh right ... present company excluded , of course ! __eou__
Mary is really a diligent girl . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She learns to speak Latin by osmosis within three months . __eou__ She is really something . __eou__
Hello , this is David . __eou__ Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ? __eou__ Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ? __eou__ That will work . __eou__ Does five thirty work for you ? __eou__ That will be fine . What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time . __eou__ Is it the plans for my new house ? __eou__ Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you . __eou__
I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . __eou__ Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . __eou__ How about the new bar across road ? __eou__ Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too . __eou__ I agree , I had lunch there last week . __eou__ Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . __eou__
I have an idea for Christmas this year . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Let's not exchange any gifts at all . __eou__ You big scrooge ! __eou__ Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it ! __eou__ But you may have some trouble convincing the kids . __eou__ Actual 1y , it was their idea first . __eou__ Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas . __eou__
Do you know anything about Dr . Miller's classes ? __eou__ Yes . Are you in his class ? __eou__ I'm thinking of taking his class next semester . __eou__ He really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . Would that be OK ? __eou__ Yes , I really need someone who is really good . __eou__ I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . Can you do that ? __eou__ Maybe , but I'm not sure . __eou__ Man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . I like that , don't you ? __eou__ No , that stuff isn't important to me . __eou__ Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field ? __eou__ I don't care about any of that . __eou__ We all are looking for different things in an instructor . I hope I've helped you . __eou__
Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ Uh ... what game ? __eou__ Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points ! __eou__ Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ? __eou__ Football of course ! __eou__ Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals . __eou__ No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer . __eou__ Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there . __eou__ So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ? __eou__ Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football . __eou__ It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ? __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . __eou__
Julia , what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__ It says a storm may come tomorrow . __eou__ Oh ! I hate rainy days ! __eou__ Me , too . I'm always in low spirits when it rains . Are you going out tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . I have to drive to Washington D . C . __eou__ What bad luck ! __eou__ Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ? __eou__ Yeah , maybe you are right ! __eou__
Where would you like to have your dinner ? __eou__ I don't care as long as it's a Chinese restaurant . __eou__ You don't like Western food ? __eou__ I really find Chinese dishes more to my taste . __eou__
Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I'm looking forward to this party , but I didn't want to go alone . __eou__ Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__ No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there . __eou__ I'll bet you were a little embarrassed . __eou__ You're right . The invitation said two to seven . I was there at two o'clock , but most people didn't arrive until three or four . They didn't start cooking until five o ’ clock . __eou__ Cookouts often start slowly . A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two . __eou__ Thanks for telling me this . __eou__ I was late getting back from the mall , but I'm hurrying . __eou__ Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it's only seven-fifteen . I don't want to be the first one there again . __eou__ Don't worry . We won't be the first . __eou__
That ’ s really a let-down . __eou__ Yeah . He really does let me down . __eou__ But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart . __eou__ I ’ m at the end of tether . I run out of ideas . __eou__
Some people are always closing their handsets , so it's difficult to inform them . __eou__ Why not send them short messages ? __eou__ Can short messages reach them ? __eou__ Short messages will be kept in the short messages center . Once they open the handsets they will receive them , which is better than you can't find them . __eou__ Why haven't I thought of this skill ? __eou__ I use short messages quite a lot . If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge . __eou__ I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call , and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ? __eou__ I almost can't live without messages , from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations . __eou__
Hey , sorry to be late . __eou__ What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up . __eou__ My mother was ill . I had to look after her . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry to hear that . __eou__
Hi ! How are you going ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ Not bad . How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time . __eou__ Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday . __eou__ Did you enjoy yourself ? __eou__ Very much . New York is such a nice place . Shall I show you some photographs ? __eou__ Thanks , I like looking at photographs . How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day . __eou__ You too . I hope to see you soon . Goodbye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
My goodness ! What happened ? You have blood on your face . __eou__ Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon . __eou__ How could you have the heart to kill it ? We only have one ! __eou__ It spoiled my painting ! __eou__
How annoying ! __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes . __eou__ Maybe there's something wrong with the program . __eou__
I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender . __eou__ That ’ s open secret . __eou__ But mine could be a lie for his job . __eou__ How did you know that ? __eou__ A little bird whispered to me . Keep that to yourself . __eou__
Who did the stupid thing ? __eou__ It must be Kate . __eou__ No , I don't think you're right.Kate never does things like that.It must be a naughty boy who did it . __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi Tina , It's Joe . __eou__ Hi Joe . __eou__ How's the weather there today ? __eou__ It's really cold . It snowed all day and the schools closed early . __eou__ What's the temperature ? __eou__ It's 30 degrees now . It was even colder this morning . __eou__ Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? __eou__ I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . __eou__ I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . __eou__ Me too . How's the weather where you are ? __eou__ It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . __eou__
Mike promised to help us . __eou__ Mike ? How can you trust him to help us ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ He is too unpredictable . He says anything that pops into his head . And then he forgets it all . __eou__
Hello , Ann ! Is that you ? __eou__ Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here . __eou__ It's been a long time ! What's new ? __eou__ Nothing much . What about you ? Is everything going well ? __eou__ Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up . __eou__ Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour . __eou__ Ok , I won't keep you then . __eou__ Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye ! __eou__ Yes , stay in touch . Bye ! __eou__ Give me your email , would you ? __eou__ Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com . __eou__
Tom , I've got good news for you . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Haven't you heard that your novel has won The Nobel Prize ? __eou__ Really ? I can't believe it . It's like a dream come true . I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize ! __eou__ You did a good job . I'm extremely proud of you . __eou__ Thanks for the compliment . __eou__ You certainly deserve it . Let's celebrate ! __eou__
Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . __eou__ Come on . We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . __eou__ I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . __eou__ Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . __eou__ I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . __eou__ OK . how does this sound , let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! __eou__ You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? __eou__ Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... __eou__ Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! __eou__
There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday . __eou__ Which flight ? __eou__ Flight 198 . Fortunately , there were few passengers . __eou__ How about the passengers ? __eou__ Well , all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally . __eou__
There are some things I miss . But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides , I grew up in Los Angeles , so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America ? __eou__ I'm going to New York to visit my sister . She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I know a lot of people have guns there . I think maybe it isn't too safe . __eou__ Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already . __eou__ Yes , I'm not really scared . Maybe only a little . __eou__ Don't believe what you see on TV . You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see ? __eou__ I want to see the museums , and I want to shop a lot . __eou__ The museums are excellent . And the shopping ! Well ! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there . __eou__ Hmm . I hope not . __eou__
I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't .

Good morning , Jerry.How ' s everything ? __eou__ Fine , just fine.Thanks . __eou__ Doing anything for lunch ? __eou__ Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . __eou__
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ? __eou__ Of course . Are you a new member here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Welcome . My name is Johnson . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ Do you have any experience using weights ? __eou__ No , I don't . So I need some help . __eou__ Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines . __eou__ Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines . __eou__ Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you . __eou__ What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one . __eou__ No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you . __eou__ I'm ready . __eou__ Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine . __eou__ I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress . __eou__ Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you . __eou__ Alright . Great . __eou__ So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here . __eou__ Great . Why don't we start on the machines ? __eou__ Are you alright ? Can you do more ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted . __eou__ That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning . __eou__ What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines . __eou__ We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? __eou__ Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . __eou__
Don't be afraid . Give it a try . __eou__ Okay . __eou__

What kind of games do you like ? __eou__ I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! __eou__ Doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? __eou__ Well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . __eou__ Did you play a lot of games when you were little ? __eou__ My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . __eou__ Do you still like playing those games ? __eou__ Not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? __eou__ Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . __eou__ Some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? __eou__ No , I prefer to play with people I know . __eou__ How about mah-jong ? __eou__ It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . __eou__ I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! __eou__ I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! __eou__
I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . __eou__ Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__

We've got a new manager in our department . __eou__ Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ? __eou__ Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too __eou__ Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? __eou__ Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! __eou__ You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? __eou__ Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . __eou__ What sort of clothes does he wear ? __eou__ A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ? __eou__ Perhaps that had something to do with it . __eou__ You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ? __eou__ It's possible , isn't it ? __eou__ Do you really think I should wear different clothes ? __eou__ Well . . . perhaps you should think about it . __eou__ Why should I wear a skirt ?

You keep bowling spares but no strike . __eou__ I don't know why , but I think there's something wrong with my hands . I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball . __eou__ I don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . You have no problem with your hands . __eou__ Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ? __eou__ The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares . __eou__ Really ? I will try again . __eou__

Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out . __eou__ The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright . __eou__ I hope so . I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days . That's what it'll take . __eou__ I have to study for an exam too . Why don't we study together . We can encourage each other . __eou__ That will be great . __eou__
The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . __eou__ Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... __eou__ The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... __eou__ What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? __eou__ First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... __eou__ Great ! __eou__

Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? __eou__ Sure , here you are . __eou__ Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? __eou__ Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . __eou__ Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . __eou__ Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy . __eou__ Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . __eou__ I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt . __eou__ Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . ' __eou__ Exactly . __eou__

Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? __eou__ Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... __eou__ Did they mutiny ? __eou__ Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . __eou__ It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . __eou__ Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... __eou__
How about a game of tennis ? __eou__ Okay . Loser has to take out the trash for a month . __eou__ It's a deal . __eou__ See you in the court . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . __eou__ You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . __eou__
Hi , John , how was your vacation ? __eou__ Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . __eou__ That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? __eou__ Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . __eou__ Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? __eou__ A little , but the rush was worth it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . __eou__ 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__ Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating . __eou__

It was even colder this morning . __eou__ Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? __eou__ I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . __eou__ I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . __eou__ Me too .

Merry Christmas ! __eou__ Huh ? __eou__ I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ? __eou__ It is ? Oh , that's nice . __eou__ Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ? __eou__ Actually , I'd forgotten about it . __eou__ Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__ Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . __eou__ It's all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian . __eou__ I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? __eou__ Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break . __eou__ Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? __eou__ Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come . __eou__
It's all over . I'm bankrupt . __eou__ Don't worry . Everything will be fine . __eou__
Bill , Happy Halloween ! __eou__ Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ? __eou__ I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs . __eou__ May I have a look at your costume ? __eou__ Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are . __eou__ I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool . __eou__ I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood . __eou__ Haha . Wish you good luck . __eou__
I think that ’ s settled . __eou__ I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! __eou__ How dare you speak to me like this . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . __eou__ Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . __eou__ That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? __eou__ Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . __eou__ So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . __eou__ I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . __eou__ Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? __eou__ I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . __eou__ It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . __eou__ It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . __eou__
OK class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ? __eou__ The brain ! __eou__ That's right , the brain ! It serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . Then what major organ is in our chest ? __eou__ The heart ! __eou__ Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ? __eou__ The stomach and intestines ! __eou__ Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ? __eou__ Yeah ! Our kidneys , liver and bladder ! __eou__ Oh yes , you are right . Very important organs indeed . __eou__ So what do these organs do , teacher ? __eou__ Well , mumm , they ... Time for a break ! We can talk about it when you get back . __eou__

When you actually play , it can be very frustrating . __eou__

I need a little more practice before I invite guests over . __eou__ Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food . __eou__ Yes .

I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food . __eou__ Both kinds of food are becoming popular.Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket . __eou__ I hope you can stay for dinner .

Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . __eou__ That's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . __eou__ Then , you're probably addicted . __eou__
Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . __eou__ I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? __eou__ I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . __eou__ I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . __eou__ It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . __eou__ You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . __eou__

She says it is very good . __eou__ Which one is that ? __eou__ You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door . __eou__ Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good . __eou__ Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ? __eou__ What time ? __eou__ At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation . __eou__ That's good . See you on Friday . __eou__
Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? __eou__ No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? __eou__ Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant . __eou__ What was that like ? __eou__ It was always very busy there . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . __eou__ Did you get any perks on the job ? __eou__ Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . __eou__
Did you like the play ? __eou__ Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either . __eou__ You're absolutely right . The acting could be better . __eou__ To be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . __eou__
I need some books on hardware . __eou__ There's many books here.What about these ? __eou__ Great ! They're the very books I want.May I borrow two books ? __eou__ Sure.But you can only keep them for a week . __eou__ I see.Thank you . __eou__
I don ’ t know why I married him . __eou__ What is the matter ? __eou__ He never see eye to eye with me . __eou__ That is to say , love is blind . __eou__
Why is the long face ? __eou__ I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more . __eou__ Did you just get your review or something ? __eou__ Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long . __eou__ That sucks . __eou__ I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies . __eou__ Look on the bright side . At least you have a job . __eou__ Yeah . I shouldn't stress about this anymore . It's not like I can do anything about it . __eou__ Exactly . Instead , we should have some drinks tonight . __eou__ How about a cold bottle of beer . __eou__ Now you're talking . __eou__
You're so witty ... __eou__ So why is the face tilted to the right ? __eou__ This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand . __eou__ So it's not as convenient for left-handed people ? __eou__ It's better for right-handed people like me . See , I don't even have to move my arm to see the time . __eou__ I'm left-handed . You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it ... __eou__ Bingo ! __eou__
Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ? __eou__ I am sorry , sir.All the tickets have been sold out . __eou__ What a shame . Will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ? __eou__ Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st . __eou__ That's fine . I want 2 tickets . __eou__
Does Tom drink a lot ? __eou__ Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . __eou__ That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . __eou__
Do you offer a course in business management ? __eou__ Yes , we do . __eou__ How many nights a week is it ? __eou__ It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . __eou__ And how long does the course last ? __eou__ It lasts for 9 months . __eou__ When does it start ? __eou__ The next beginning class starts on October 25th . __eou__ What time is the class ? __eou__ From 7 to 9 o'clock . __eou__ How much does it cost ? __eou__ It costs 125 dollars a month . __eou__ Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . __eou__ Thank you , please fill out this form for us . __eou__ Do you want me to fill it out now ? __eou__ Yes , please . We need a record of you education and your work experiences . __eou__

I have to pick up a lot of credits this year . __eou__ What ’ s your major ? __eou__ I ’ m majoring in French literature . __eou__ Oh , don ’ t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It ’ s really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long . __eou__ That ’ s right . We got the assignment last week . __eou__ When is it due ? __eou__ Next Monday ! __eou__ Remind me never to sign up for that course ! __eou__

What would you do if you won the lottery ? __eou__ Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . __eou__ If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! __eou__ My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! __eou__ Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? __eou__ If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! __eou__

I think I can handle it . __eou__ Well , if you change your mind , let me know . __eou__ I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ I might need some tools though .

Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . __eou__ OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company . __eou__
I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? __eou__ I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it . __eou__ It's really very easy saying you're sorry . __eou__ Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it . __eou__
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? __eou__ I suppose I do . __eou__ The climate here is pleasant . __eou__ They use said it __eou__ This city is really comfortable to living . __eou__ It sure is __eou__ No other city can match it . It's heaven . __eou__ Well , if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__ That's for sure . __eou__
Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ? __eou__ Yeah , I know . __eou__ I didn ’ t know it until yesterday . I put my foot into it , and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married . __eou__
Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . __eou__ I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! __eou__ That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . __eou__ It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . __eou__ They see their independence as a kind of character strength . __eou__ Sometimes they are too independent . __eou__
How are you making out ? __eou__ I'm doing fine.Don ' t mind me.It ' s a wonderful birthday party.Everyone is enjoying himself . __eou__ I hope so . Thank you again for your delightful gift . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Happy Birthday , Mary ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . __eou__ What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love this ? __eou__ I had my own ways of finding out . It's a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . __eou__ Maybe you don't believe it , but it was made by my grandmother . __eou__ Really ? It looks so nice . __eou__ Thank you . Please have a cup of tea . __eou__ All right . __eou__ How about some fish ? __eou__ No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake . __eou__ OK , let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? __eou__ No , just a small one . Next let's sing ' Happy Birthday ' to Mary . __eou__ It is very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . __eou__
How did you meet your girlfriend ? __eou__ I met Amanda through a friend . __eou__ That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ? __eou__ We started dating right away . __eou__

I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ? __eou__ He's not doing too well . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong ? __eou__ About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time . __eou__ Is it due to old age or is he sick . __eou__ Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . __eou__ That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life . __eou__ That's what my father tells me almost everyday . __eou__ Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me . __eou__ Thanks . I'll let him know . __eou__
Wedding rings ! __eou__ Oh , no ... __eou__ Aren't they cool ? I like the settings . __eou__ Jen , is there someone you're not telling me about ? __eou__ No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ? __eou__ Women are such dreamers . __eou__ These are specially designed for the year 2000 ! __eou__
Hurry up , get in . __eou__ I ’ m in , let ’ s go ! __eou__ OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up ! __eou__ Geez ! What ’ s the rush ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it ! __eou__ Are you nuts !

Move , move ! __eou__ What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! __eou__ Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady ! __eou__ I ’ m going as fast as I can ! __eou__ Yes ! We made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes . __eou__ You ’ re such a geek ! __eou__
I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ? __eou__ Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ? __eou__ Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ? __eou__ Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ? __eou__ Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ? __eou__ No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ? __eou__ The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ? __eou__ Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ? __eou__ No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to visit France . I'd like to travel all over the world . As you describe it , France seems to be very much like Japan . I would like to see it for myself . __eou__
I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . I smell some rat in it . __eou__ He is sly . He is actually angling for compliments . But he may have got the crush on you . __eou__ Nonsense ! There's no indication that he's in love with me . __eou__ Keep your fingers crossed . He may pop the question one of these days . __eou__
Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? __eou__ I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . __eou__ I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? __eou__ Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . __eou__
Maybe we'd better go now . __eou__ It's still early . __eou__ Gosh , it's already 10.Stay here if you like . __eou__ Since we're late , let's go to see a film . __eou__ OK.Hurry up . __eou__
My uncle passed away last night . __eou__ My condolences . __eou__
Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ? __eou__ Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ? __eou__ I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind . __eou__ Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ . __eou__ Why ? You seem pretty sure about it . __eou__ Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life . __eou__ But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it . __eou__ That's why people's achievement varies greatly . __eou__ That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them . __eou__ Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ? __eou__ I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives . __eou__ Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ? __eou__ Just as Forrest ? __eou__ Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ . __eou__ I got it . __eou__
Come on ! It's time to go ! __eou__ Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? __eou__ Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first . __eou__ That won't take long . __eou__ Well , it won't if there no line at the pump . __eou__ Well , I'm not quite ready . __eou__ I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! __eou__ You wouldn't do a thing like that ! __eou__ Oh , yes , I would ! __eou__
How's business ? __eou__ So so . __eou__
Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . __eou__ Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . __eou__ Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . __eou__ I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . __eou__ I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . __eou__ You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore __eou__ Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . __eou__ Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . __eou__ Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . __eou__ Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints . __eou__ My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? __eou__ You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . __eou__
Which language do you speak ? __eou__ Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . __eou__ How do you find studying a language on the internet ? __eou__ It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . __eou__ I bet you find the character difficult to write ! __eou__ Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . __eou__ So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? __eou__ Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? __eou__ In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should tell me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I am telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you would be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__ Oh , you men ! You are all the same . __eou__
So , did you go out with Richard ? __eou__ Yeah . We went to a movie last Saturday . We saw Police Partners II . __eou__ Did you like it ? __eou__ Richard did , but I didn't . Of course , I told him I liked it . __eou__ Yeah . So did you do anything else ? __eou__ Well , we went to a dance club . __eou__ Did you have fun there ? __eou__ Yeah , we had a great time . And we're going to go there again next week ! __eou__
Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ? __eou__ I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market . __eou__ So you will continue to study for a master's degree ? __eou__ Well , I think so . But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . If can get a Ph . D . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home . __eou__ How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad . __eou__ I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship . __eou__ It could be pretty tough studying abroad . Being so far away from home ... __eou__
It's hard to get tickets for the movie . __eou__ Did you get any ? __eou__ Yeah , two at the tenth rows . __eou__ How much is the ticket ? __eou__ 3.5 dollars each . __eou__
What a great weekend that was ! __eou__ My feeling's exactly . __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ We should come here more often . __eou__ You are absolutely right . __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend . __eou__
I think Andy's party will be fun . __eou__ Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? __eou__ Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? __eou__ My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Smith . Are you enjoying the cookout ? You don't look too happy . __eou__ I spent the morning at the cemetery . I put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies . __eou__ Is that what people usually do on Memorial Day ? __eou__ They should . This holiday is about remembering our war dead . But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts ! __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Thank you for telling me a little more about it . __eou__
I went to Super Junior's concert last night . It was fantastic . __eou__ Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs . __eou__ Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard . __eou__ I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers . __eou__ The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ? __eou__ Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now . __eou__ Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday . __eou__ If you would like me to , I could help you with that . __eou__ Wouldn't that take you away from your project ? __eou__ I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me . __eou__ Is there a good time for you to help me ? __eou__ If we work on this tomorrow night , you could easily be ready by Friday . __eou__ How about meeting in my office ? __eou__ That would work out well . Bring any concerns that you might have . __eou__ Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot . __eou__ Don't worry . Everything will go well . I promise ! __eou__
If you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? __eou__ Why ? Did tom pop the question ? __eou__ Not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . __eou__ Let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? __eou__ You are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . __eou__ I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . __eou__ Oh , how did you deal with it ? __eou__ I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? __eou__ Simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . __eou__ Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . __eou__ Yes , he said it would be better for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . __eou__ So that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . __eou__ Not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . __eou__
Where is Tom ? __eou__ He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . __eou__ What ? It ’ s only 9p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? __eou__ He ran four miles and came back dead beat . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Hi , Ann . __eou__ Hi . You look excited . What's happening ? __eou__ I just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days . __eou__ And you're planning to enter ? __eou__ Of course . This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice . __eou__ Is there a prize ? __eou__ I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio . __eou__ Do you think you have a chance ? __eou__ A chance ? Not just a chance , I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful . __eou__ But you haven't practised all that much . __eou__ I still have 5 days to practise . It's in the bag ! __eou__ Don't be too sure . You're still going to need some help . __eou__ Yeah , maybe . __eou__
I've got to go to bed . Have to work tomorrow . __eou__ OK . Good night , then . Have a good sleep . __eou__ Good night . See you tomorrow . __eou__
I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . __eou__ That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? __eou__ Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? __eou__ Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . __eou__ I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant . __eou__
What day is today ? __eou__ Today is Thursday . __eou__ What's the date today ? __eou__ Today is May first , 2003 . __eou__ Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ? __eou__ Well , I don't think so . __eou__
Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ? __eou__ That would be fine . Where are you going ? __eou__ We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing . __eou__ Great . __eou__ And don't forget your fishing tackle . __eou__ Ok . I like fishing very much . __eou__
Daniel , what are you doing here ? Aren't you supposed to be at school now ? __eou__ The same question to you . __eou__ Well , we shall make it a secret between us . __eou__ Deal , Where is Gucci ? __eou__ She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come . __eou__ Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA . __eou__ I want to be like her . __eou__ Get real . Don't be so pathetic . __eou__ Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that . __eou__ Oh , man , look at her , go ! She is amazing ! She should be my sis . __eou__ Boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ? __eou__ Yes , I want to be her boyfriend . Just like in the movie . __eou__ Are you out of your mind ? __eou__ She told me she liked my new haircut . She thought it was cool . __eou__ Go ahead , have a try and be a joke . __eou__
You know John ? __eou__ Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . __eou__ And he ’ s bright and intelligent .

But you must pay a deposit for the card . __eou__ There will be a refund when I return the card , right ? __eou__ Yes , if the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches . __eou__ OK , here you are . __eou__
I am very proud of John . __eou__ Me too . No one has expected he can really get somewhere with his business . __eou__ But he has suffered a lot . __eou__
What do you think of the plan for the new airport near here ? __eou__ Perhaps they should give it a second thought . The residents are getting up in arms about it . __eou__ I think they will . __eou__
What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them . __eou__ You're becoming a real television watcher . __eou__ A lot of people feel the same way . __eou__
May I invite you for a dance ? __eou__ With pleasure . __eou__ You dance well . Do you breakdance ? __eou__ Me , what brought that on ? __eou__ There's a story about breakdancing in the paper . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style . __eou__ Like disco ? __eou__ Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance . __eou__ And disco a kind of nightclub . __eou__ Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ... __eou__ So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . __eou__ You are witty . __eou__
Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ? __eou__ That would be a possibility . Where is this fundraiser taking place ? __eou__ It is in the hotel ballroom down the street . __eou__ Do you need it for the whole weekend ? __eou__ We will need it for both days . __eou__ We will need to know who will be driving the van . __eou__ The van will be driven by Mary and me . __eou__ It needs to be back on Sunday night . Can you arrange for that ? __eou__ Oh yeah , no problem . Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom . __eou__ Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening . __eou__
Guess who I saw yesterday ? __eou__ I don't know . Who ? __eou__ Avril Lavigen ! __eou__ the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? __eou__ yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... __eou__ so you're a big fan , eh ? __eou__ not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . __eou__ and she was in a movie once again , right ? __eou__ yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . __eou__ what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? __eou__ she looked sweeter than her pictures . __eou__ did you take a photo with her ? __eou__ no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . __eou__ crazy ! __eou__
Can you lend me fifty bucks ? __eou__ What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ? __eou__ I guess I don't earn enough . __eou__ No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem . __eou__ That's my business , not yours . __eou__ True enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important . __eou__ So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ? __eou__ I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises . __eou__ I'm not disciplined enough I guess . __eou__ In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits . __eou__
How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? __eou__ I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . __eou__ I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . __eou__ If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars . __eou__ How would you do that ? __eou__ I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . __eou__ I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example . __eou__ I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . __eou__ The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular . __eou__ That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . __eou__
What day is today ? __eou__ Today is December twenty-third , two thousand and two . __eou__ Oh , The day after tomorrow is Christmas . __eou__ Merry Christmas to you . __eou__

The bridegroom looks a bit nervous . __eou__ On this occasion , most people do . __eou__ Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come . __eou__ She is a beautiful bride . __eou__ I am so happy for them . __eou__ Are you crying ? __eou__ Yes , I always cry at weddings . __eou__ Harris and Anne are perfect for each other . __eou__ Yes , they are . __eou__ You and Tom also make a great couple . __eou__ In fact , we are beginning to make preparations . __eou__ For the wedding ? __eou__ No , no , for the engagement . __eou__ Try to catch this bouquet then . __eou__
Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . __eou__ is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? __eou__ yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . __eou__ I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? __eou__ I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . __eou__ yeah , that's nice . __eou__ hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . __eou__ a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? __eou__ I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__ I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . __eou__
Have you got your invitation yet ? __eou__ My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? __eou__ The house warming party . __eou__ Whose house warming party is it ? __eou__ Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . __eou__ Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately . __eou__ It's out in the suburbs . __eou__ Have you seen the house ? __eou__ Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . __eou__ Is it nice ? __eou__ Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden . __eou__ Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? __eou__ They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . __eou__ When are they going to have the party ? __eou__ Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . __eou__ Wow , that would be something to look forward to . __eou__
Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city . __eou__ I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . __eou__ I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . __eou__ Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? __eou__ Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train . __eou__
Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air . __eou__ I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ? __eou__ why not ? I love animals and I love nature . __eou__ You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun . __eou__ sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there . __eou__ Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here . __eou__ That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing . __eou__ I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm . __eou__ Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try . __eou__ I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first . __eou__ Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ? __eou__ Of course . I will . __eou__ Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun . __eou__ It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider . __eou__ No problem . It is always worth trying something new once in your life time . __eou__
how are you doing ? __eou__ I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . __eou__ what happened to him ? __eou__ he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . __eou__ was it his first offence ? __eou__ unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . __eou__ what happened to him then ? __eou__ not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . __eou__ did they take his license away ? __eou__ no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . __eou__ what do you think will happen to him ? __eou__ well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . __eou__ that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? __eou__ not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . __eou__ my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . __eou__ that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . __eou__
Well , sir , we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant . __eou__ Is that so ?

I think we have the same musical tastes . __eou__ But if we're going to start a band , we have to be able to sing and dance .

What can you do to help me ? __eou__ I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out . __eou__ Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough ! __eou__ If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out . __eou__
Can you tell me something about financial aid ? __eou__ What exactly ? __eou__ How to apply for it ? __eou__ In your first letter , that is , when you apply for admission , you should also tell them you need their financial aid . __eou__ Then ... __eou__ If the aid is available , they will give you two or more application forms , One is for admission , the others are for the aid . __eou__ What if not ? __eou__ They will tell you the aid is impossible . __eou__

What is there to do after we graduate ? __eou__ Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president . __eou__ I'm honored that you think I would be qualified .

How is the college search going ? __eou__ It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . __eou__ But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? __eou__ It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... __eou__ I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... __eou__ Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low . __eou__ I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction.He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . __eou__ Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search . __eou__
I ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for . __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . What ’ s the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other .

Excuse me , Professor . I am going to miss next week's class . __eou__ Is this something that you could schedule for another time ? __eou__ No , I have to do this ; it's important ! __eou__ Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you ? __eou__ I've made arrangements with a friend to help me . __eou__ You know that I only allow one absence per semester , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I know . __eou__ Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me . __eou__ OK , I can do that . __eou__ Well , have a good day off from class . __eou__
It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you . __eou__ Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ... __eou__ This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ... __eou__ I'll tell you all about it another day . __eou__ But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ? __eou__ You ladies look very elegant in black .

The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! __eou__ Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . __eou__ On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . __eou__ As much as I love this city , I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . __eou__ I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect . __eou__ What is the greenhouse effect exactly ? __eou__ It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . __eou__ I see , so it's similar to global warming ? __eou__ They're related to one another , yes . __eou__ I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . __eou__ People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . __eou__ People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . __eou__ I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . __eou__
What would you like to do tonight ? __eou__ I'm not sure . __eou__ What about going to a movie ? __eou__ OK , let's go to the cinema to see what's on . __eou__

I should thank you . __eou__ Shut up ! __eou__ No , listen to me . Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well . Maybe in other people's eyes , I want you to be my girl-friend . but ... but ... __eou__ But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't . __eou__ OK ... OK ... Anyway . I will treat you as my best friend . I hope you can do the same . __eou__ Leave me ! Go away ! __eou__
Would you mind doing something for me ? __eou__ I would if I could . __eou__ Would you please explain the meaning of the word ? __eou__ Yes , With pleasure . __eou__

We have a subsidiary company l __eou__ Are the reports favorable ? __eou__ Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is a __eou__ That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? __eou__ Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . __eou__ I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them . __eou__ Sure . There you are . __eou__
Can you imagine a boat letting in the river ? __eou__ That would be terrible . __eou__ Sure thing . I have an experience like that . __eou__ Oh , how were you saved finally ? __eou__ I was in such a panic at that time . Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning . __eou__

He followed me all the way home ! __eou__ That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__ Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . __eou__ Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__

How did you choose courses when you were abroad ? __eou__ That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor . __eou__ Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you . __eou__ Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . __eou__ Everything is so new to me . I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there . __eou__ Sure , very difficult . __eou__ I am very grateful for your advice . __eou__ It's my pleasure to talk with you . __eou__
So it is hard to be a black student on campus ? __eou__ Yes , in many ways it is . There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life . __eou__ Stereotypes ? Like what ? __eou__ Well , like since I'm black , I must like rap music , come from the inner city , or play basketball well . __eou__ I do know you like rap music , but the other two are definitely false . I ’ Ve seen you play basketball . __eou__ Hey ! But that's not the only problem . There's also the affirmative action stigma . __eou__ You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota ? That's not true at all , you're really a smart guy . __eou__ I know that , but some people don't think like that . And I get problems from teachers as well . __eou__ Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all . __eou__ Racist ? Not exactly . It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . Suddenly I become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion . __eou__ I see . It looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the US . __eou__
Could you help me ? __eou__ What do you need ? __eou__ I can't seem to find my class . __eou__ What building is it in ? __eou__ It's in the C building . __eou__ Oh , I know exactly where that is . __eou__ Do you think you can tell me where it is ? __eou__ Sure , what room number is it ? __eou__ It's room number 261 . __eou__ I have a class around there right now . __eou__ Could you show me where it is ? __eou__ No problem , come on . __eou__
John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ? __eou__ Yes , I watched once . __eou__ What do you think of it ? __eou__ Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I'd say it's really a special art form . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . Actually , I'm a Beijing Opera fan . __eou__ Really ? Good for you . __eou__
Let ’ s play a game ! __eou__ OK ! How about Scrabble ? __eou__ No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! __eou__ OK ! __eou__ Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! __eou__ Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! __eou__ Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! __eou__ Your future husband ! __eou__ Not funny . __eou__
Hi Julie , how are things going ? __eou__ Everything is great , Tad . How are you ? __eou__ I'm doing really well . __eou__ Tad , I'm pretty hungry right now . Want to walk over and check out the food table ? __eou__ Julie , do you know who that woman is over there by the window ? __eou__ That is Mary . I heard that she's just moved in with Lee . __eou__ I thought that he was with Malia . __eou__ Oh , that relationship is history . Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday . __eou__ I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that ! __eou__ Actually , he was OK with it . They hadn't been getting along too well . __eou__
You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable . __eou__ I was not born yesterday . __eou__
So , Emily , how was your day ? __eou__ I don't think you really want to hear about it . __eou__ It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . __eou__ To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! __eou__ That's not very fair . What did you do ? __eou__ There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . __eou__ Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? __eou__ He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! __eou__ Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? __eou__ I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! __eou__ Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? __eou__ Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . __eou__ That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders . __eou__ I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . __eou__ That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . __eou__
Can you speak English ? __eou__ Yes I can . I speak it very well . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ I lived in England when I was a child . __eou__ What else can you speak ? __eou__ Well , I know a little Italian . __eou__
Hi , Maggy , Did you hear about David ? __eou__ About David , No , I didn ’ t hear anything . __eou__ You know , about David and new boss . __eou__ Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you . __eou__ Well , I hear David have been fired . __eou__ Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . __eou__
How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? __eou__ We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . __eou__ What do you think his strengths are ? __eou__ Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . __eou__
Which school is your children in ? __eou__ She is now in a private school . __eou__ Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school . __eou__ It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools . __eou__ But the private school amount to better schools . __eou__
I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it . __eou__ How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ? __eou__ It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters . __eou__ That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ? __eou__ Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . __eou__ If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . __eou__
I really like the record you lent me the other day . __eou__ I'm glad you like it . __eou__ And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it . __eou__ I'm glad . __eou__ Would you mind my keeping it for another week ? __eou__
We'd like to have a look around your house ? __eou__ Yes , of course , please follow me . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ This is our courtyard . __eou__ It's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ? __eou__ Yes , about 46 square metres . __eou__ Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ? __eou__ They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time . __eou__ Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness . __eou__
So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ? __eou__ Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand . __eou__ You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ? __eou__ Actually it will be my first time to meet her . __eou__ You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then , how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her . __eou__ That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month . __eou__ Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast . __eou__ The Internet is making interaction much faster . People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way . __eou__ Probably you ’ re right . __eou__
Hi ! Susan ! I haven't seen you for ages ! __eou__ I've been really busy . How is everything ? __eou__ Oh , fine . Hey , why don't we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ? __eou__ Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? __eou__
Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing . __eou__ It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp . Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels . __eou__ There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__ Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes . __eou__ And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows . __eou__ What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! __eou__ Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! __eou__
Hello __eou__ Hi Angela , it's Dan . __eou__ Hi B . How are you ? __eou__ Good . __eou__ I called you yesterday . Did you get my message ? __eou__ Yes , I was taking a shower when you called . I saw that you called and I tried to call you back , but I think your phone was off . __eou__ No problem . I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . You're still coming to the wedding with me , right ? __eou__ Oh , is that next week ? __eou__ Yes . Did you forget ? __eou__ No , of course not . I already bought them a present . __eou__ That's good . I want to invite Megan also . Next time you see her , can you tell her for me . __eou__ Sure . Does she know your friend ? __eou__ Yes , I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . I'm not exactly sure how they know each other . __eou__ Are we all going to drive together ? __eou__ Yes . I'll pick you up first , and then we'll go get Megan . __eou__
Hey , look at the offer I got in my e-mail . It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home ! __eou__ Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean that you're gullible . You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet . __eou__ But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money . __eou__ Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ? __eou__ Pyramid scheme ? What is that ? __eou__ It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . __eou__ Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him . __eou__ Not exactly . The scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom . __eou__ What happens then ? __eou__ Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam . __eou__ I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is . __eou__
We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning . What do you say we take a break and listen to some music , okay ? __eou__ Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine . __eou__ While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator . __eou__ You sure have a lot of discs here . __eou__ Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ? __eou__ Sorry , my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960 ' s . Music written before then is just history to me . __eou__ Well , speaking of history , let's get back to the books.We ' Ve got an exam tomorrow , remember ? __eou__
When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? __eou__ Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . __eou__ How about Sunday then ? __eou__ Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? __eou__ Does 6,30 suit you ? __eou__ It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . __eou__ Thanks , goodbye . __eou__
I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains . __eou__ I agree , I think that that would be perfect ! __eou__ I was thinking it could take place sometime in January . __eou__ That might be a little too cold for some people . __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__ What about April ? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot . __eou__ Yes , that would work out better . __eou__ You know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone . __eou__ Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it . __eou__ Fine ! Well , I'll get right on it now ! __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I need to check these books out . __eou__ Do you have your library card ? __eou__ Here it is . __eou__ It appears that you have late fees . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , really . __eou__ How much do I owe ? __eou__ You owe $ 24.50 in late fees . __eou__ I don ’ t have that much today . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , but until you pay it , you won ’ t be able to check out any more books . __eou__ I ’ ll pay it as soon as possible . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__ Huh ? __eou__ I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ? __eou__ It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice . __eou__ Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it . __eou__ Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__ Because I ’ m not Christian , I ’ m Jewish . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know . __eou__ It ’ s all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I ’ m Christian . __eou__ I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? __eou__ Well , I ’ ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break . __eou__ Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? __eou__ Not at all . A party is a party . I ’ ll be happy to come . __eou__
Do you want to go shopping with me ? __eou__ That's a good idea.What time is good for you ? __eou__ How about Saturday morning ? __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
Welcome , young man . No offence , but I haven't seen you here before . __eou__ Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card . __eou__ Okay then . You are the younger customer here ever . __eou__ It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market . __eou__ It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ? __eou__ Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ? __eou__ That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up . __eou__ I am still young . And I'm growing every minute . __eou__ Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope . __eou__ I love running . Anything else ? __eou__ Please change your clothes first ! __eou__ I'm perfect with my clothes . And I do not have anything else with me . __eou__ Sorry , but no jeans here . __eou__ Oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . I'd better just go home . __eou__
I hear that the Students ' Union is going to take new members . __eou__ Really ? Can I join it ? __eou__ Of course you can if you like it . __eou__ How can I join it ? __eou__ There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday . You can apply for it then . __eou__ OK , thank you . __eou__
Is that girl your girlfriend ? __eou__ No , it's not . __eou__ She doesn't look like our classmate . __eou__ Don't mistake her as somebody . She ' s my older sister . __eou__ Really , she's so pretty . __eou__
What do you do in summer ? __eou__ I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? __eou__ I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . __eou__ What do you do in winter ? __eou__ Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . __eou__ I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer , you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . __eou__ Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! __eou__ Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? __eou__ Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! __eou__
Happy new year ! __eou__ Thank you . Same to you . __eou__ Have you got any plans ? __eou__ I've been invited over to a friend ’ s , and you ? __eou__ My roommate ’ s having a party . __eou__
Do you offer a course in business management ? __eou__ Yes , we do . __eou__ How many nights a week is it ? __eou__ It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . __eou__ And how long does the course last ? __eou__ It lasts for 9 months . __eou__ When does it start ? __eou__ The next beginning class starts on October 25th . __eou__ What time is the class ? __eou__ From 7 to 9 o'clock . __eou__ How much does it cost ? __eou__ It costs 125 dollars a month . __eou__ Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . __eou__ Thank you , please fill out this form for us . __eou__ Do you want me to fill it out now ? __eou__ Yes , please . we need a record of you education and your work experiences . __eou__
Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? __eou__ I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . __eou__ How would you solve the problem ? __eou__ I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . __eou__ It would probably be very expensive . __eou__ I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i __eou__ It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . __eou__ If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . __eou__ Most voters what everything both ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . __eou__ The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . __eou__ Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly __eou__
Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? __eou__ No , I'm scared of cats . __eou__ Oh , but why ? __eou__ I feel they're dirty . __eou__
Would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things . __eou__ Well , they are very nice you know . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And not expensive either . __eou__ Oh , I don't care about that . __eou__ Everybody is buying them . __eou__ Are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . __eou__ I am afraid I am not interested in fashion . __eou__ I see . __eou__ But thank you very much all the same . __eou__ Sorry I couldn't help you . __eou__
Come in , come in ! __eou__ Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? __eou__ I thought we were supposed to meet HERE . __eou__ Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? __eou__ You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . __eou__ It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . __eou__
how was school today , Dominic ? __eou__ I hate school ! __eou__ why ? What happened ? __eou__ I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today ! __eou__ it's just one exam . Can you re-take the exam ? __eou__ yes , but it's so humiliating ! I don't want my friends to know I failed ! __eou__ why didn't you do a good job ? __eou__ I don't know . I sat down in my seat , looked at my paper , and then my mind just went totally blank . __eou__ do you think you studied enough for the exam ? __eou__ no ... __eou__ what did you do last night ? __eou__ I watched TV . __eou__ did you study at all last night for your exam ? __eou__ no , not really . __eou__ I am sure if you had studied , you would have done well . When can you re-take your exam ? __eou__ tomorrow . __eou__ alright . Get out your books and I'll help you prepare . __eou__
I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . __eou__ They have moved to Chicago . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Mr.Smith has changed his job . __eou__
Did you hear about Joe ? She hasn't eaten for days . __eou__ Why ? What's eating her ? __eou__ Love sick . You know who she's in love with ? __eou__ I don't have the slightest idea . __eou__ Someone you're living with . __eou__ What ? Not my Dad , I hope ! ? __eou__ Come on , Mary , it's your brother , Jack . __eou__ No kidding ! Jack is such a log ! He's never dated a girl . __eou__ The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him . __eou__ And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection . __eou__ Well , if you want to help your friend , you should do something about it . __eou__
Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ? __eou__ Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never got it . __eou__ Better luck this time ! __eou__
How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ? __eou__ At least , it is better than my boxed lunch at work . I'm so fed up with the bland food . Thank you for having lunch with me ! __eou__ Any time . But I don't mind eating boxed lunch . The food sanitation is really good too . __eou__ It's hard to believe that you like it . You are so easy to be satisfied . __eou__ Hey , it's not that bad . The food is nutritious and it's really convenient . I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff . __eou__ Eating is important . You are what you eat . It's not only a daily routine . __eou__ Well , will you just go back to work after lunch ? __eou__ No . I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch . __eou__ But you didn't eat anything today . __eou__ Well , the bill is paid by month . That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant . __eou__ All right . I'm going to the McDonald's . __eou__ For what ? I thought you didn't like western food . __eou__ No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . __eou__ That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . __eou__ Me , either . But , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one . __eou__ That's for sure . It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children . __eou__
What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I need to return a book . __eou__ Can I do anything else for you ? __eou__ I want to check these books out . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ That ’ s all . __eou__ May I see your library card , please ? __eou__ It ’ s right here . __eou__ Will that be all for today ? __eou__ Yes . That ’ s it . __eou__ These are due back in two weeks . __eou__ All right . Have a good night . __eou__
Which sports are popular in your country ? __eou__ Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . __eou__ Do many people like tennis ? __eou__ More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . __eou__ In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . __eou__ Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . __eou__ I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . __eou__ A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . __eou__ There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . __eou__
Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player . __eou__ Oh , you're welcome . __eou__
You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? __eou__ Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . __eou__ Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? __eou__ No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . __eou__
I've come to say goodbye . __eou__ When do you leave ? __eou__ I'm catching the eleven o'clock train . __eou__ Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . __eou__ Goodbye . Hope to see you again next year . __eou__
The weather is terrible . __eou__ Yes . It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now . __eou__ I'm wearing my heavy jacket . __eou__ I'm going to put on more clothes , too . __eou__ Will it snow today ? __eou__ I don't know . Do you like snowing ? __eou__ Yes , when it snows , every where is white . It's very beautiful . __eou__ You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
This city is far too polluted . We should do something about it . __eou__ I agree . We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often . __eou__
I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country . __eou__ Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry . __eou__ No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it . __eou__ It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach . __eou__ Is it just a bus ? __eou__ Oh . no .

Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals . __eou__ Do you have a New Year's resolution ? __eou__ I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution .

Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work . __eou__ That seems reasonable . We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square . __eou__ Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight ! __eou__ Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck ! __eou__

I ’ d love to have my own farm . __eou__ It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . __eou__ Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . __eou__ That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . __eou__ You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . __eou__ My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . __eou__ Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . __eou__
We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? __eou__ no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? __eou__ what about a factory tour ? __eou__ you mean visit a factory ? __eou__ yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . __eou__ good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . __eou__ really ? What do the companies do that for ? __eou__ I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__ oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . __eou__ exactly . __eou__ do we need an appointment beforehand ? __eou__ I'll call the tourist information centre to check . __eou__
Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . __eou__ How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . __eou__ The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . __eou__ Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? __eou__ Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . __eou__ I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? __eou__ Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . __eou__ If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . __eou__
There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow . __eou__ It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible . __eou__ Yes . We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading . __eou__ It may take many years for the trees to grow . I hope people will stop cutting down trees . __eou__ But we need the wood . __eou__ But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood . __eou__
What are you guys doing ? __eou__ Just having a chat . __eou__
What ’ s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ? __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job . __eou__ Then , buy a bottle of soft drink . __eou__ Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ? __eou__ It ’ s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now . __eou__ Ok , I will go there myself . __eou__ Sorry , Mr . Polly . __eou__ It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ? __eou__ Have a try . __eou__

What ’ s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ? __eou__ I look at myself in the mirror .

Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one , especially if it ’ s winter and I need to warm up . __eou__ Do you shave every morning ? __eou__ I shave every workday , but I only shave at weekends if I ’ m going out somewhere .

I must see your receipt . You can't have your money back without receipt . __eou__ Oh , I'm not certain , but I think I've lost it . __eou__

Let me clear away the broken glass . __eou__ No , I can manage it myself.Just sit down , please . __eou__ It's very careless of me to have broken your glass . __eou__ Never mind . __eou__
Have you followed the value of dollar lately ? __eou__ How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . __eou__ It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . __eou__ Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . __eou__ What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in . __eou__ What about the Yen ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! __eou__
What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . __eou__ Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . __eou__ Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . __eou__ While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries . __eou__ That is a really interesting fact . __eou__ I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . __eou__ Just do whatever you feel like doing . __eou__ ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree . __eou__ Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . __eou__ I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand . __eou__

I just moved here a few months ago . __eou__ where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from China . What about you ? __eou__ I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago . __eou__ did you enjoy it ? __eou__ I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ? __eou__ it's very different from Chinese food , but I am getting used to it . __eou__ Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there ? __eou__ yes , have you read it ? __eou__ no , but I saw the movie . What do you think about it ? __eou__ well , to be honest , I've only gotten though 10 pages of it .

It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . __eou__ ( After they entering the park ) Great , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me . __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your right . __eou__ Oh , I see them . Beautiful weather should be shared by all the people . __eou__ Ah , you changed so fast . __eou__
How was the party last night ? Did you enjoy it ? __eou__ Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had . __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well . Mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind . __eou__ What about the party ? __eou__ It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . __eou__ So how long did you stay ? __eou__ I left after the opening dance . I couldn ’ t wait to get out of there . __eou__
Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ? __eou__ Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip . __eou__ I guess I need all of them . __eou__ Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home . __eou__ I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time . __eou__ Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock . __eou__
Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ? __eou__ Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures . __eou__ I feel they all talk and behave in a different way . __eou__ They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys . __eou__ Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ? __eou__ She is certainly not my kind of girl . __eou__ Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes . __eou__ You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either . __eou__ I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this , that two solitude protect , border and salute each other . ' __eou__

She's like that with everyone . __eou__ I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . __eou__

Maybe going around for a while . __eou__ Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? __eou__ Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . __eou__ Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . __eou__ You hit the nail right on the head . __eou__ Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . __eou__ Awesome .

He may probably give you the bag . __eou__ I'm sure of what I'm doing . __eou__
Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ? __eou__ You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . __eou__ How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? __eou__ He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . __eou__ Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here . __eou__ You think he might stay even longer ? ! __eou__ Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated ! __eou__ That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! __eou__
I've got an idea . Let's make this game even more interesting . __eou__ How ? Do you want to play strip-trivia or something ? __eou__ Well , if you want to !

What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
I like your new skirt . __eou__ Do you think it fits me ? __eou__ Yes . It looks terrific ! __eou__ I bought it at half price . __eou__ You were lucky to find it . __eou__

A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__
This small town has many serious problems . __eou__ What's the cause ? __eou__ The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . __eou__ I see why it lags behind other towns . __eou__

I---I ’ m proud of you . __eou__ Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . __eou__ I---I don ’ t feel like saying it . __eou__
You missed the film.That ' s a shame . __eou__ Is it stimulating ? __eou__ Yes . I got very excited . __eou__ I hope I still have chances . __eou__
Hello , this is the admissions office . Can I help you ? __eou__ Hi . I ’ m calling about your continuing education program . __eou__ What would you like to know ? __eou__ I want to become certified in computer programming . Do you offer any part-time courses for adult further education ? __eou__ Yes , we offer both night and weekend courses in a number of different subjects . __eou__ How do I sign up ? __eou__ If you give me your address , I can mail you an information packet and the application forms . __eou__ Great ! __eou__
How nice of you to come ! __eou__ It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How have you been ? __eou__ Just fine , thanks.And you ? __eou__ I've never been better , thanks . __eou__
Marquet , do you think I should enroll in the science course ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course . __eou__ Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses . __eou__ Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors . __eou__ Yes , I'm really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . __eou__ That's a problem . __eou__
Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love . __eou__ Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? __eou__ To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . __eou__ That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ? __eou__ After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . __eou__ Sounds like a lot of work ! __eou__ Anything worth doing takes work . Money doesn't grow on trees ... Most of us have to work for it . __eou__
You went out on a date last night , didn't you ? __eou__ Yes , I did , but Linda stood me up . She didn't keep the date for the first time . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ Why don't you phone her for a date again ? __eou__ I did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . I think she is going to walk out on me . __eou__ Don't jump to conclusions . Look at the bright side , try to make another date again . __eou__ I will . Thanks for your advice . __eou__
Happy birthday , Aims ! __eou__ Thank you , Lisa . __eou__ Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . __eou__ Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . __eou__ I'm very glad to hear that . __eou__ Come here ; let me introduce some friends to you . __eou__
Bill , do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers ' Day ? __eou__ I know the Chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985 . __eou__ So , it is the 27th Teachers ' Day . __eou__ What will you do on Teachers ' Day ? __eou__ I am going to send Mr . Li some flowers . What about you ? __eou__ I intend to invite him to dinner . __eou__
I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine . __eou__ Does it work ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . The report says it is better than the old vaccines . __eou__ Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner . __eou__ Right . That ’ s why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness . __eou__
Harry was angry last night . __eou__ That's because he's getting nervous . Anyway , this is the first time he's directed a play . __eou__ But he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . It's not like Harry to do a thing like that . __eou__ Yes , you're right . Maybe there's any other reason . __eou__
Did you get any pizza ? When I got there , only small one was left . What a pity ! __eou__ I got the short end of the stick . __eou__
Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment . __eou__ Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . __eou__ Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in Shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . __eou__ No problem . Call me when you get back . __eou__ I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ? __eou__ That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you . __eou__ Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . __eou__ Great ! That's settled then . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ? __eou__ Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing ! __eou__ Why are they all in glass boxes ? __eou__ For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air . __eou__ So there isn't air in the glass boxes ? __eou__ No , there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box . __eou__ I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ? __eou__ Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time . __eou__ Hey , look at the tripod . I've seen it on TV . __eou__ It was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless ! __eou__
Honey come on ! We are going to be late ! Honestly , you take longer getting ready than I do ! __eou__ I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help . __eou__ What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ? __eou__ I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . __eou__ Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat . __eou__ Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense.Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I need to return these books . __eou__ Give them here . __eou__ Here they are . __eou__ It appears these books are two weeks late . __eou__ I forgot they were due . __eou__ You do realize you are going to have to pay late fees , right ? __eou__ How much is the late fee ? __eou__ The late fee is 25 cents a day . __eou__ So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late ? __eou__ It ’ s 25 cents for each book . __eou__ That ’ s a lot of money . __eou__
So what kind of music turns you on ? __eou__ Rock'n'Roll , I guess . __eou__ You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? __eou__ Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . __eou__
Hi , Robert . What happened to your face ? It looks swollen . __eou__ I had to go get a cavity filled today . __eou__ Did it hurt ? __eou__ I don't even wanna talk about it . It killed me ! __eou__ How long were you in the chair ? __eou__ It took quite a while , but the worst part was getting numbed . They had to give me 3 shoots . __eou__ Well , I guess you've learned a good lesson , huh . You have to take good care of your teeth . __eou__ No kidding . Not only can ’ t I stand the pain , but man ... dentists are expensive . The bill is going to be humungous ! __eou__ Don't you have a dental insurance ? __eou__ I do , but it still does not cover everything . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__ The same to you ! __eou__ Are you doing anything special ? __eou__ We're having some friends over.What are you doing ? __eou__ Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . __eou__
OK , guys . Here's the plan . Get the ball to the goal , and keep it away from Rich and Taylor ! __eou__ Why ? Are they good ? __eou__ They played ball at school . Here we go . Yi-jun , go out for a pass ! __eou__ I'm ready ! Whoa , what a hard throw ! I can't get that ! __eou__ Catch it , Yi-jun ! Run to the ball ! Uh-oh ! Slow down , you're going to hit ... __eou__ Ummmph ! __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class . __eou__ There are no countries marked on the map . __eou__ No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world . __eou__ The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny . __eou__ I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall . __eou__ Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon . __eou__ The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate . __eou__ It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . __eou__
What are you up to tonight , Steve ? __eou__ I'm going to a disco with my friends . __eou__ That sounds like fun . Have a good time . __eou__
Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . __eou__ John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . __eou__ I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . __eou__ Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? __eou__ Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . __eou__ I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families . __eou__ I think you ’ re right ! __eou__
What is today ? __eou__ Thursday . __eou__ So the weekend is coming ! How about seeing a film ! __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__
Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A __eou__ It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca __eou__ There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__ Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes __eou__ And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some __eou__ What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! __eou__ Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! __eou__
What do you think about studying in the U . S . ? __eou__ Well , for many international students , coming to the United States and living here and studying can be quite a daunting experience , especially when finding a house on campus or off campus . __eou__ Do you have any advice ? __eou__ I think first of all for first-time students , coming and living on campus in dormitories can provide a certain level of security . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Uh , when you live off campus , there might be a certain amount of flexibility in choosing roommates that you might not have when living on campus . __eou__ I will think over your advice . __eou__ Well , of course , the choice is up to you . Good luck ! __eou__ I really appreciate your help . __eou__
Who is that guy ? __eou__ It's Clive of course . Where did you come from ? Every girl knows Clive ! __eou__ Really ? He is my type . __eou__ He is everybody's type . __eou__ What position does he play ? __eou__ Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan ! __eou__ Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement . __eou__ Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now . __eou__ Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer . __eou__ That is not true . They are just jealous of him ! __eou__ Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart . __eou__ You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow . __eou__ By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ? __eou__ You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . __eou__ Oh , My chance is slim then . __eou__
Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . There are about forty or so that are hot . You should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . The rest are categorized according to potential and interest.You can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack . __eou__ Haha ... please don't tell me you've got a dead stack . I hate making cold calls ... __eou__ Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain . __eou__ Don't worry , I've gotchy covered . __eou__
Where's your hometown ? __eou__ Shandong . __eou__
I just got laid off . The awful business , you know . __eou__ I ’ m very sorry to hear about that . So are you all right ? __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m better after talking to you . __eou__ Oh , you poor thing ! __eou__
What will you do now ? Propose to her . __eou__ Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once . __eou__ You should strike while the iron is hot . __eou__ You're right . I will have a talk to her about that . __eou__
How do you usually get to school ? __eou__ I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? __eou__ I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . __eou__ I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! __eou__ I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . __eou__ Cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . __eou__ Do you have a car ? __eou__ No . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . __eou__ Maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . __eou__ You could try . It would save you a lot of money . __eou__ That's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . __eou__ If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! __eou__ I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! __eou__ Let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . __eou__ Sounds good ! Let's go ! __eou__
Bob is really handsome . __eou__ That's why he's very popular among girls . __eou__ I wish I were just as handsome . __eou__ You are ! __eou__
How's your new work , Carl ? __eou__ A tough job . They even offer in-service training every Wednesday afternoon . __eou__ Good for you . __eou__ I don't like it . I am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours . Above all , I hate talking to those poker faces everyday . __eou__ Well , you have to take the bad with the good . __eou__ I guess so . I am badly off and I need this job . __eou__
What can I help you with today ? __eou__ When does the library close ? __eou__ The library closes at six o ’ clock . __eou__ Does it close at that time every day ? __eou__ Not always . __eou__ Is the library open on Saturdays ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ What time do you open and close on Saturday ? __eou__ The hours are from 9 am - 6 __eou__ Okay . Thank you very much . __eou__ Do you need anything else ? __eou__ No , that ’ s all . Thanks . __eou__
I can't wait until my car is repaired . The commuting with public transportation is killing me . __eou__ It can't be that bad . __eou__ But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . __eou__ At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day . __eou__ That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ? __eou__ I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office . __eou__ I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit . __eou__ Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine . __eou__
Why are you so rude to your wife ? __eou__ I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . __eou__ But she means to help you , not to trouble you . __eou__ I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . __eou__
What he said disappointed me . __eou__ What did he say ? __eou__ He advised me to change to a more suitable course . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women . __eou__ It is stupid to say so . __eou__
What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . __eou__ I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? __eou__ In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . __eou__ Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! __eou__ A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? __eou__ I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? __eou__ They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . __eou__ In what way ? __eou__ Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . __eou__ You are making me feel really discouraged . __eou__ I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! __eou__
You look happy . __eou__ I am happy . I just bought a new car . __eou__ Wow ! Is it a good car ? __eou__ It ’ s a great car . It ’ s very comfortable and it goes really fast . __eou__ Was it expensive ? __eou__ Put it this way – it wasn ’ t cheap . __eou__ What colour is it ? __eou__ It ’ s red and black . __eou__
Let's meet tonight at the Thai restaurant at about 5 . __eou__ Fine , I'll take a taxi . __eou__ Why don't you walk ? It's only about 20 minutes walking and it's a nice evening . __eou__ Never thought about it , I sure you are right . It's quite a short walk . __eou__ Ha-ha , see you then . __eou__
Professor , do you have a few moments when I could meet with you ? __eou__ I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday ; what works best for you ? __eou__ Three would be a good time . __eou__ Great , do you need directions to my office ? __eou__ I'm not sure . __eou__ Well , just make sure to go through the double doors , and I'll be on the right . __eou__ OK , I'll find it . __eou__ It's very easy to find . __eou__ See you then . __eou__ I will enjoy seeing you ; have a good week ! __eou__
The boy threw up . __eou__ That's disgusting . __eou__
Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . __eou__ Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! __eou__ Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . __eou__ That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . __eou__ That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . __eou__ Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . __eou__ Now that ’ s a great idea ! __eou__
Happy birthday , Ms . Lin . Here is a present for you . __eou__ Oh , thank you ! It's very kind of you . Ah , it is a porcelain vase . __eou__ I hope you like it . __eou__ Yes , it is lovely . I have been expecting something like this for a long time . Thanks ever so much . __eou__ I am glad you like it . __eou__
Cheer ! __eou__ Cheer ! __eou__ So what time tomorrow ? __eou__ Half past seven in the morning . __eou__ Where to meet ? __eou__ In the market . __eou__ OK . Bottoms up . __eou__ Bottoms up . __eou__ It's on me . __eou__ Thank you . This place is nice . __eou__
Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ? __eou__ Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ? __eou__ No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter . __eou__ Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes . __eou__ What's the temperature today anyway ? __eou__ I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius . __eou__
Good evening , Mr.Brown . __eou__ Good evening , David.Good evening , Mary.It ' s so good of you both to come . __eou__ It's nice of you to invite us . __eou__
what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ? __eou__ it's Beethoven . Do you like it ? __eou__ I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ? __eou__ I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax . __eou__ what other kind of music do you listen to ? __eou__ actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ? __eou__ to be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me . __eou__ what kind of music do you prefer then ? __eou__ I like pop music . Do you ? __eou__ not really . I don't think pop music has much depth . __eou__ I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . __eou__ how long have you been in to pop music , then ? __eou__ I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? __eou__ not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . __eou__ so , how did you become interested in it ? __eou__ well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started . __eou__ do you still play piano ? __eou__ yes , it's one of my hobbies . __eou__
Want to join me for a midnight snack ? I need to grab something to eat . __eou__ Fine with me , but no more chafing dish . __eou__ Let's go to the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner . __eou__ I'd love to try some snacks . __eou__ ( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ? __eou__ Kebabs and roast squid . __eou__ Can I have a bite ? __eou__ Help yourself . __eou__ Super ! __eou__
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , I've been sitting here for a few minutes . I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car . __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . But this is the self-service pump . __eou__ Self-service ? __eou__ Yes . You must fill up the car yourself . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes . Are you traveling here ? __eou__ Yes , I'm from Taiwan . I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car . __eou__ In America , most gas stations are like this . __eou__ Do I really have to do it ? I don't know how . __eou__ Well , since this is your first time , I will do it for you.But next time , if you want a full-service gas station , you should look at the sign . __eou__ What sign ? __eou__ Under the sign for the gas station , there will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service.And some gas stations have both.But if they have both , some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve.You have to look at the signs . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Oh , no . It looks like my computer really has caught a virus . __eou__ Why ? Did you open an attachment ? __eou__ Yes , something called “ George W . Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes . __eou__ I kind of like it . He looks better that way , doesn't he ? More presidential . __eou__ I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys . __eou__ Yeah , their expressions were exactly the same ! __eou__
John seems to be in high cotton . He may well become a big shot . __eou__ I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder . __eou__ What is your idea ? __eou__ Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear . __eou__
Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information . __eou__ Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day . __eou__ It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines . __eou__ Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ? __eou__ Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin . __eou__ I like to read Fortune . __eou__ Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too . __eou__ Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases . __eou__ A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc . __eou__ But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect . __eou__ You are right about that . __eou__
Hi , Li Ming . You look upset . What's the matter ? __eou__ There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it . __eou__ Why ? We can leave school earlier that day . __eou__ I didn't do well in last exams . If my father knows it , he will beat me up . __eou__ I can't believe it . My parents never beat me . __eou__ You know that my father is irritable . __eou__ You can ask the teacher for help . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . __eou__ Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . __eou__ Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . __eou__ Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog . __eou__
I hope the host team loses . __eou__ That all depends on how the visiting team shapes . __eou__ According to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in America . __eou__ But two players of the team have been booked and one is out . __eou__
Hi honey ! You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! __eou__ Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! __eou__ I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . __eou__ You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . __eou__ Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t know . __eou__ Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! __eou__ Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party ! __eou__
Aren ’ t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world . __eou__ I just don ’ t find it very interesting . __eou__ I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event . __eou__ I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries . __eou__ I think the Olympics help to promote world peace . __eou__ I ’ m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other . __eou__ You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete . __eou__ Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics . __eou__ Now there we are in agreement ! __eou__
You have a lovely house , Jack . __eou__ Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . __eou__ That's too bad . What problems are you having . __eou__ Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . __eou__ I ’ Ve studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? __eou__ Go right ahead . __eou__ Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room __eou__ Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . __eou__
What are you hiding in your coat pocket ? __eou__ It's a camera . __eou__ You want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ? __eou__ Not even funny , Billy . This is my new snapshot sticker camera . __eou__ What's that supposed to mean ? __eou__ Well , there are adhesive strips on the backs . You can stick them anywhere . __eou__
Sorry.What was that you said ? __eou__ I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven . __eou__ Where ? __eou__ At the Gate . __eou__ When , did you say ? __eou__ Round about seven . __eou__ Who's coming ? __eou__ Peter.Peter Brown , you know.Don ' t forget to bring the letter . __eou__ Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said.There ' s a lot of noise outside . __eou__ I told you not to forget to bring the letter . __eou__ Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy . __eou__
I broke my sister's mirror . I'm sure it'll get her back up . I really don't know how I can escape the punishment . __eou__ You'd better tell your sister what happened and face the music . __eou__
My accountant thinks she can save me lots of money on my taxes this year . __eou__ That sounds great ! __eou__
How's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? __eou__ To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . __eou__ I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ Sure , but how ? __eou__ You can ask her out for drinks after work . __eou__ But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . __eou__ Then you've got a lot of work to do . You need to get her to notice you first . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__ You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying ' hello ' to her . __eou__ But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . __eou__ That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most girls prefer being chased . __eou__ I see . I'll try . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
Excuse me . May I come in ? __eou__ Sure . Come on in . __eou__
i saw lily for the first time . and fell like i'v been struck by lightening.she is a girl of my dreams . i have a date with her on Friday , but i really can't decide what to do . __eou__ what about taking her for a dinner or a movie ? __eou__ not bad , any other ideas ? __eou__ well , there is a play on campus this weekend . __eou__ good idea . that ' s why i think i have culture . you have any other suggestions ? __eou__ what's the matter with these ideas ? __eou__ They are good , but i still need a few more . __eou__ what about going on a picnic ? __eou__ Cool , but what if the weather is not ideal ? __eou__ you can also take her to the art museum or a cafe .

Where did you stay ? __eou__ Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . __eou__ So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . __eou__ I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . __eou__ Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? __eou__ I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . __eou__ It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . __eou__ It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . __eou__

It is very windy on the lake . __eou__ Then we can take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the park . __eou__

Now he ’ s hanging some strong strings on the nails . __eou__ And what ’ s Mrs . King doing ? __eou__ She ’ s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ’ s putting it ... OK . __eou__ What ’ s happening ? __eou__ The ladder ’ s falling ? __eou__ What ’ s Mr . King doing ? __eou__ He ’ s hanging from the string . He ’ s holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs . King . __eou__ And is she helping him ? __eou__ No , she ’ s running toward our house . That ’ s her ringing the bell . __eou__ Well , I ’ m not going to answer it . I ’ m sleeping . __eou__

I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . __eou__ It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead . __eou__ I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . __eou__ What did the critic say ? __eou__ He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . __eou__ The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . __eou__ Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . __eou__ I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . __eou__
this is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . __eou__ are you serious ? __eou__ yes , I mean it . __eou__ but why ? Did I do anything wrong ? __eou__ no , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . __eou__ hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that .

What kind of prizes ? __eou__ Well , I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car ! __eou__ A new car ! You're kidding ! __eou__ No , really ! And she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear ! __eou__ Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ? __eou__ Of course !

Have you ever witnessed any crimes or accidents ? __eou__ I don't quite remember .

All the routine work really browns me off . __eou__ Oh , come on.You ' Ve just started . __eou__ I wish I hadn't chosen this job . __eou__
Yuck . The carrots taste awful and salty . Hi sis , how do you like them ? __eou__ I like them very much . They are delicious . __eou__ Well , you can have all my carrots . __eou__ Daniel , hold on for a minute . What are you trying to pull there ? __eou__ Nothing .

It's about time for some dessert . __eou__ Oh , you want my chocolate cakes , so to speak ! __eou__ No , no , I'm just thinking of some dessert .

Hey . I'm a visitor from China . I love your music . It's the best I've ever heard . Will you please spare a little bit of time for me ? __eou__ Sure . Thank you for saying that . Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months . __eou__ Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ? __eou__ You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too . __eou__ Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ? __eou__ I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players . __eou__ Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future . __eou__
Could you come and spend the weekend with us ? __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid I can't . I've had a date already . __eou__ That's too bad ! __eou__ Maybe some other time . __eou__
Excuse me . I don't think we have met before . My name is Mary Jenson . __eou__ Oh , hello . I'm Bias Chettri . __eou__ Good to meet you , Mr Chettri . __eou__ Pleased to meet you too , Ms Jenson . __eou__

I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ? __eou__ Certainly . Mr .

It ’ s very kind of you . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__ This is it ? __eou__ It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working . __eou__
Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . __eou__ Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . __eou__ You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . __eou__ Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? __eou__ I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . __eou__ Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . __eou__ At least you know what American women generally like in a man . __eou__ Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard . __eou__ American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . __eou__ No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . __eou__ You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . __eou__
Have you heard that new song by the Beastie Boys ? __eou__ Why do you listen to rap ? __eou__ It's not much different from that heavy metal music you like so much . __eou__ Heavy metal music is a lot different from rap music.You can dance to heavy metal . __eou__ Hey , you can dance to rap music ! __eou__ I can't dance to it . And I know you can't either . Because I've seen you try . __eou__
What's your new girlfriend like ? __eou__ Katherine ? Well , she's good at languages . __eou__ Does she know how to speak Spanish ? __eou__ She knows how to speak Spanish and Japanese . __eou__ Wow ! ! ! __eou__ And she's good at sports , too . She knows how to play tennis and basketball . __eou__ That's terrific ! __eou__ But there's one thing she's not good at . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ She's not good at remembering things . We have a date , and she's an hour late ! ! __eou__
Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... __eou__ Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner . __eou__ Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ? __eou__ That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy . __eou__ And when do you prepare for your final exam ? __eou__ Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam . __eou__ Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? __eou__ Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . __eou__ Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! __eou__ But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late . __eou__ Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ? __eou__ Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy . __eou__
What's today's date ? __eou__ It's January . __eou__
You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? __eou__ I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . __eou__ What was your childhood like ? __eou__ I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me . __eou__ Where did you go to university ? __eou__ My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . __eou__ What is your current occupation ? __eou__ I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . __eou__ Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation ? __eou__ No , I didn ’ t . I started working at a university in London but as time went by , I found I did not really like my job . I decided to explore other fields . Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge . __eou__ Do you like your current job ? __eou__ Yes , I came to Beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities . I was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company . __eou__
Do you want a cigarette ? __eou__ No , thank you . I've given up , you know . __eou__ You don't mind if I have one . __eou__ Well , all tight . But you know , smoking does do harm to your health . __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__ Why don't you try and give it up ? __eou__ I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no use . __eou__
Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see ! __eou__ Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ? __eou__ Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now . __eou__ Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ? __eou__ Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count . __eou__ That sounds smart ... but kind of boring . __eou__ Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends . __eou__ That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ? __eou__ Definitely pre-med . What about you ? __eou__ I still have no clue ... but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so I've got time ! Oops , I'm late for class . Gotta run ! __eou__ OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you ! __eou__ Yeah , you too ! __eou__
Whatever we do , we should do it above board . __eou__ You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . __eou__ Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about it through other channels . __eou__
How did you get into hip hop ? __eou__ Well , all my friends listen to it , so I became a big fan too . __eou__ Who is your favorite hip hop artist ? __eou__ I'm a big fan of Snoop Dog . __eou__
It ’ s over . __eou__ What is over ? __eou__ Our relationship . I mean my friend and I ... __eou__ Any reasons ? __eou__ The cause is another boy . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s too bad . __eou__
How did you do on your BELTS exam ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . __eou__ That's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? __eou__ Yes .

We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! __eou__ Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading __eou__ That is preposterous ! __eou__ You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! __eou__ I am not wrong ! The chicken came first ! __eou__ No ! The egg came first ! __eou__
My husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . I'm fed up with it . __eou__ Maybe you two should go see a marriage counselor . __eou__
Charles , have you finished your homework ? __eou__ Not yet , Grandma , What's the matter ? __eou__ I want you to have a walk with me . __eou__ I'll finish soon . __eou__
Did you lock the doors ? __eou__ All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk . __eou__ Well , I ’ m going on to bed . I ’ m beat . __eou__ Ok , I ’ m going to stay up awhile . I ’ Ve got to go over the household budget , We ‘ re a little over-spend this month . __eou__ Please told Tim to close the door to the basement . I don ’ t want dog down there tonight . __eou__ Ok , Good night , see you at breakfast . __eou__
Have you ever played Making ? __eou__ Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . __eou__ Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . __eou__ Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . __eou__ It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . __eou__
My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German . __eou__ What a great idea ! Now you have a friendly audience to practice with ! __eou__ The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English . __eou__ Oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too . __eou__ That's right . And it's a B that I'll be writing too . Her name is Olga . __eou__ Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English . __eou__ That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ? __eou__ I don't know , but you know how to surround yourself with great friends ! __eou__
I just had a terrible week . __eou__ What a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no ! __eou__
Hi , Jenny . You look like you are in a hurry to somewhere . Where are you going ? __eou__ I am going to the bank . I need to cash some checks . __eou__ That's great . We can go to the bank together . __eou__ Why are you going there ? __eou__ I will go to Japan on business for 5 days next Tuesday . I want to exchange some Japanese yen . __eou__ I see . Will you bring a lot of money with you ? __eou__ Not really . I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan . __eou__ Do you have the bank card in Japan ? __eou__ Nope . You can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries . __eou__ That sounds really convenient . Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ? __eou__ No . It is free of charge . __eou__ Great ! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later . __eou__ I think we are running out of time . The bank is going to close soon . __eou__

It depends on where you are and what position you are in . For instance , if you are in an elevator and you smile , you will make other takers uncomfortable . __eou__ That ’ s an exception . But I am fed up with those who keep a straight face in front of me . __eou__ I cannot see eye to eye with you here . You see , I am fed up with those who keep smiling to me . I mean , they smile for no reason at all . __eou__ That means you don ’ t like them . If you hit it off with them , you will like to see their smiles . __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
I ’ m betting the New York Yankees win . How about you ? __eou__ Well , I ’ m favor of the Red Sox . They ’ Ve had a good season . __eou__ Sorry , guys . Could I just interrupt for a moment ? My money is on the Yankees ! __eou__ That ’ s not a very good pick . I ’ m against the Yankees . __eou__ Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m with you on that . __eou__
When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . __eou__ What do the Romans do ? __eou__ They live in Rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk . __eou__ In other words , the Romans do what everyone else does . __eou__ Yes , but they do it differently . Everything is different . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , the climate's different for a start . It doesn't rain so much as it does in England . The sun shines more often . __eou__ I envy them the sun . __eou__ I know . You hate the rain , don't you ? __eou__ I certainly do . __eou__ And a Roman really Ioves life . Eye knows how to enjoy himself . __eou__ They always eat spaghetti and drink wine , don't they ? __eou__ Not always . But they like a good meal .

So , are you enjoying the performance so far ? __eou__ Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? __eou__ I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . __eou__ Do you know anyone in the play ? __eou__ Actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . __eou__ Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? __eou__ That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . __eou__ So you've seen other plays that he's directed ? __eou__ Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to meet the cast !

Maybe I'll just be a cheerleader . __eou__ C'mon , Yi-jun . It's lots of fun . You've seen football played on TV . __eou__ Uh , yeah . And I've seen guys in pads tackled . We have no pads . I don't want to be tackled . __eou__ There's barely any contact in touch football . People just tag you to stop the play . __eou__ OK , but they better tag lightly ! __eou__
Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you . __eou__ Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already . __eou__ It ’ s all right . __eou__ I was caught in the heavy rain , or I would have come earlier .

I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . __eou__ I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school . __eou__ Yes , sometimes . __eou__

You can't do so many things at the same time . What exactly do you want ? __eou__ I don't know . Do you have any advice for me ? __eou__ yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal . __eou__ I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career . __eou__ no , you can't waste your time wandering around . If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working __eou__ thank you so much for your advice .

Look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like Versacci , Calvin Klein , and Vivienne Westwood . What do you think of them ? __eou__ Well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . I mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? __eou__ I know what you mean . People would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . I suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties . __eou__ Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money . __eou__ I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . __eou__ You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ? __eou__ Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ . __eou__ Very philosophical . I think they design these clothes more for publicity . They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish . __eou__ Come on . All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes . __eou__
David , I ’ m going to China . __eou__ Really ? How do you get the chance ? __eou__ You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward .

China is such a beautiful country . __eou__ I ’ m sure I will . __eou__ Have a nice journey , Lily . __eou__ Thank you , David . __eou__
Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum . __eou__ Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ? __eou__ I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . __eou__ I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum . __eou__ Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be . __eou__ Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ? __eou__ I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map __eou__ Sure , take your time . We have a whole day . __eou__ It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece . __eou__ Look at the museum guide.It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide . __eou__

It's quite warm now . __eou__ Where do you live ? __eou__ In London.Where do you live ? __eou__ Here.Near this school . __eou__
I've been looking forward to the new semester . __eou__ I hope we can make great progress in this new semester . __eou__ Hope so . __eou__ I hear we'll have a new English teacher this semester . __eou__ Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance . __eou__ I am sure we will . __eou__
Post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? Years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money . __eou__ Nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . Take mailing for example . Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ? __eou__ I save money in a post office saving account . There used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . They each have different conditions and interest rates . __eou__ You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . You can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and Christmas cards ... __eou__ Post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits , like unemployment benefit and child support benefit . The queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment . __eou__ My son likes going to the main post office . They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection . __eou__ Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ? __eou__ I think it ’ s better for some things , like sending and receiving money , but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to . __eou__ I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places __eou__
She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth ! __eou__ Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within . __eou__ Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air . __eou__ She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ? __eou__ Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things . __eou__ They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it . __eou__ That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ? __eou__
It sounds that you have a high opinion of him . __eou__ He is an all-right guy . I have no bone to pick with him . __eou__ Birds of feather flock together . __eou__ But he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river . __eou__ You cannot judge a person that way . I have a hunch that he is a sly dog . __eou__ Depends on with whom . He may be doing things on the sly , but he is honest with me . I trust him . __eou__ You can never tell . He might do you in when he sees an angle in doing it . __eou__
Welcome ! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here ! __eou__ So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time . __eou__ If I hadn't married an Italian man , I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos ! __eou__ Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families . __eou__ It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy ! __eou__
What was that noise ? __eou__ It was the pilot putting the wheels down.We must be coming into land.Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking ! __eou__
Two people were robbed last night near the park . __eou__ Again ? The area around the park is too dark at night . There should be more lights there . __eou__ I am afraid of the dark . I don ’ t feel safe in the dark . I feel someone is hiding in the dark to attack me . __eou__ Your feelings might be right . You should never walk alone there at night . It is too dangerous . __eou__ I Know . And you should be more careful , too . __eou__
Well , that's it . 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week . __eou__ It's certainly a tight schedule . __eou__ Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday . __eou__ At what time ? __eou__ My last appointment is at 3 , so I should be free by 5 at the very latest . I think I could get to the airport by 6 . __eou__ Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5 ? __eou__ No , not really . __eou__ So you are not sure how long it will take to get there ? __eou__ No , but I am sure it won't take more than an hour . __eou__ Don't forget it's Friday nighty . If Frankfurt's anything like London , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly . __eou__ You are a pessimist . __eou__ I am a realist . __eou__

Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening ? __eou__ I park days and evenings . __eou__ Be careful about the time limits on the streets . Have you seen the signs for time limits ? __eou__ What signs ? __eou__ As long as you are careful reading the signs , you will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there . Are you aware of the curb colors ? __eou__ What curb colors ? __eou__ If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload , you are going to be OK . __eou__

Let's go . __eou__ shouldn't we make an appointment first ? __eou__ we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . __eou__ whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! __eou__

So , how's your work ? __eou__ Good . How about you ? __eou__ I am going to resign . A few of the new staff have already left . Obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries . __eou__ But your company is huge .

what kind of music do you like listening to ? __eou__ I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it ’ s too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power . __eou__ you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ that ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . __eou__

Do you think I still fashionable in this dress ? __eou__ I think so . Blue is still very fashionable at the moment . __eou__ This style came out last year , though . I like the dress , but I ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year . __eou__ I think this kind of dress will stay in fashion for a few more years . People don ’ t change fashions every year . It would be too expensive . __eou__ Yes . Only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year , but only rich people can do it . __eou__ There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes . __eou__ I wish I could be one of those people , but my budget simply doesn ’ t stretch that far . I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy . __eou__ I know what you mean . The situation will be worse if we marry our boyfriends and have children . The we ’ ll have even less money to spend on fashionable clothes ! __eou__

Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it . __eou__ Why ? Just read your notes.You can see what the professor stressed in the lectures.Probably the exam will ask about things he stressed . __eou__ Yes , but my notes are all nonsense . I can't figure out what is important . __eou__ Let me see them.Are these all the notes you have ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But Laurie , how can you do well in school if you don't take more notes ? __eou__ What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough . __eou__ I'm sure you don't write enough.Look at this . Here you wrote , Russian Revolution . 1917 . Bolsheviks . Real revolution , or coup ? And that's all ? I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question.And you didn't write any of it ! __eou__ I know , but I listened . __eou__ Yes , but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember . __eou__ I suppose you're right . But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down . __eou__ There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down . __eou__ That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot . __eou__ Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard . __eou__ Alright . University and high school seem very different to me . I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better . __eou__
What are you grinning about ? __eou__ Stephany said she would go out with me . __eou__ I thought mom said no dating till you are 16 . __eou__ That ’ s in one month , and besides , this is a group date with all of our friends . __eou__ All of your friends , what are you planning to do ? __eou__ We ’ re going fishing . __eou__ What a party ! I hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish . __eou__ These girls are different , they are not wimpy . __eou__

For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way . __eou__ Well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful ! __eou__ I hope you are right . __eou__

Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy .

Professor Wang looks so handsome today . He is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie . __eou__ He always wears an extremely becoming suit with tie . __eou__ He ’ s quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . He gets different tie each day . __eou__ A light brown suit and a pink tie today , and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday . A perfect match ! __eou__ The tie is necessary for man . It makes you look so attractive in a super tie . __eou__ Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important . __eou__ My father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat . __eou__ My father wears a tie every day , but he can ’ t do it himself . My mother helps him with his tie every morning . __eou__ You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife . __eou__
There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . __eou__ What is a tornado warning ? __eou__ It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . __eou__ Really ? In New Berlin ? __eou__ No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a " tornado watch . " That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . __eou__ I understand . They think a tornado might come . __eou__ Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a " watch . " __eou__ And the second stage is called a " tornado warning " . __eou__ Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a " tornado warning " . So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . __eou__ It's scary . __eou__ Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . __eou__ What do you mean " a loud train " ? __eou__ That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . __eou__ But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? __eou__ Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . __eou__ Have you seen a lot of them ? __eou__ I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . __eou__ Did it hit their house ? __eou__ No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . __eou__ What were they doing when you called ? __eou__ They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . __eou__ That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? __eou__ Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . __eou__
Actually the general manager is regarded as a baby doll . He has much sympathy . __eou__ That's right . And his wife is a baby doll , too . She used to have many followers . __eou__ Were you one of them ? __eou__ Nothing of the sort . I can't hold a candle to her . __eou__
You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ? __eou__ Why am I always the last to know these things ? __eou__ I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ? __eou__ No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing . __eou__ How obnoxious ! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes . __eou__ He not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him ! __eou__
Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ? __eou__ I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . __eou__ Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that . __eou__ Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . __eou__ All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . __eou__ Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . __eou__ That's exactly what I want , thank you . __eou__
How did your interview go ? __eou__ Pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . __eou__ If you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? __eou__ If I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . __eou__ Will you get a pay-raise , too ? __eou__ Whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . __eou__ That makes sense . Who interviewed you ? __eou__ My boss . __eou__ What kinds of questions did she ask you ? __eou__ She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . __eou__ The second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? __eou__ I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . __eou__ Those are good answers . How did she react ? __eou__ She told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . __eou__ What do you think about her as a boss ? __eou__ She's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . __eou__ You're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__ That's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__ When you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__ I will do . __eou__

Jordan is the only good player Washington has . __eou__
How are your parents these days ? __eou__ Oh , they're fine , still very active and enjoying their retirement . __eou__ Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Please give my best regards to them when you're home . __eou__ Sure , thank you . __eou__

I don't think the teacher had a right to say that.The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class . __eou__ You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so . __eou__ I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately . __eou__ You're right.If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that . __eou__

I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . __eou__ Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? __eou__ I'm really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . __eou__ You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? __eou__ You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film " . __eou__ It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the “ best actor and actress ” . __eou__

You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ? __eou__ In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone . __eou__ You are not going to give it up , are you ? __eou__ No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either . __eou__ I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it . __eou__ Yes , but whom to ? __eou__ Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August . __eou__ That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . __eou__ Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then . __eou__ Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . __eou__

How's your business ? __eou__ Everything seems to be getting worse . I don't know what to do with it . __eou__ Things are tough all over .

I like summer but I don't like winter . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter ? __eou__ Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . __eou__
God , I didn ’ t realize . I didn ’ t , I didn ’ t know ... __eou__ ... Who you were with ? I didn ’ t know whom you were with . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s from the Godfather . It ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and AAAL ! Never mind . __eou__ You were spying on me , weren ’ t you ? You probably rented those children . __eou__ Why would I spy on you ? __eou__ Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner . __eou__ The entrance to our store is around the corner . And there ’ s no other way of saying that . It ’ s not the name of our store . It ’ s where it is . And you do not own the phrase around the corner . __eou__ What is that ? What are you doing ? You ’ re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ? __eou__ Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year . __eou__
Hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? I ’ m starving . __eou__ We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out . __eou__ Out ?

Do you want to order some pizza ? __eou__
Have you been in America long , Hellen ? __eou__ No . Only for a couple of weeks . __eou__ Where are you going to study ? __eou__ I am going to register at Harvard next month . __eou__ What are you going to major in ? __eou__ I am going to major in tourism . What about you ? How long have you been here ? __eou__ For nearly four years . __eou__ Well . You should be able to give me some advice on where to stay .

After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that . __eou__
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Let's say about 6:00 ? __eou__ That's OK with me . __eou__

They're carrying bottles of champagne ! __eou__ That's because it's time . __eou__ Time for what ? __eou__ It's time to make our wedding wish come true ... __eou__ You mean get married now ? On the plane ? __eou__ Why not ? I've got the rings ready . __eou__ I don't know what to say , Jack ! __eou__ Hopefully , you'll say " yes " ... __eou__

We have invited all our relatives to the wedding . __eou__ It will be a large church one . Is your wedding dress ready ? __eou__ Yes , its design is very elaborate and the designer took many weeks to make it . __eou__ You will be very beautiful on your wedding day . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__ Which hotel will the reception be held at ? __eou__ The Palace Hotel . __eou__ It's excellent . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth . __eou__ I think you made the right decision . __eou__

Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ? __eou__ I needed some money , so I hocked it last week . __eou__ You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that . __eou__ I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . I hit the ceiling when I saw that . __eou__ It sounds like you weren't expecting that . __eou__ I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away . __eou__ Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some . __eou__ Thanks , but tomorrow's payday I can make until then . Thanks any-way . __eou__
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? __eou__ Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! __eou__ Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! __eou__ Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? __eou__ Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . __eou__ And then what did happen ? __eou__ Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . __eou__ Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are ! __eou__ Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! __eou__ Count me in ! __eou__
Cheers ! To our first night in our new apartment . __eou__ It's so quiet . I'm not really used to it . __eou__ All you hear is the crickets and the breeze . __eou__ It's a little eerie . I'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me . __eou__ Well , I think it's fabulous . And the neighbors don't even seem to exist . __eou__ That is a relief . It's a good thing we moved . __eou__
Ms . : Do you have a question , Mary ? __eou__ No . That's not why I raised my hand . I need to go to the ladies ' room . __eou__ Ms . : Let me give you a hall pass for it . __eou__ What's a hall pass ? __eou__ Ms . : With a hall pass , you can go to the ladies ' room or wherever you need to go during class time . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Ms . : If a teacher stops you in the hallway , just show him or her the pass . __eou__ Or else I'll get into trouble . __eou__ Ms . : That's right . __eou__
What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? __eou__ Don't believe him . He's a liar . __eou__ We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__
So , you friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . __eou__ My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy . __eou__ That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? __eou__ Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . __eou__ So , what did you get them ? __eou__ I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with it ? __eou__ She says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . __eou__ Household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . __eou__ I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten years at most . __eou__
hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? __eou__ not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . __eou__ why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . __eou__ I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! __eou__ Really ? What's the series about ? __eou__ well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . __eou__ it sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . __eou__ I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . __eou__ really ? that's interesting ! __eou__ yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . __eou__ OK , I'll give it a go . __eou__
I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! __eou__ So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? __eou__ That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! __eou__ Have you ever written up a business plan before ? __eou__ Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? __eou__ You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . __eou__ Well , that seems easy enough . __eou__ Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . __eou__ Geez . Is that all ? __eou__ Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! __eou__ Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! __eou__
Are you a blogger ? __eou__ Sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years . __eou__ Oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? __eou__ I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . __eou__ What do you usually write about ? __eou__ At first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going . __eou__ That's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? __eou__ It's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . __eou__ Got it . Are you still updating your blog ? __eou__ Sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like . __eou__ Good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . __eou__
What are you doing this Saturday ? __eou__ Not much . __eou__ Do you want to go see a movie ? __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ What's playing at the Century Fox ? __eou__ Candlelight in the Window __eou__ Should we go see it ? __eou__ I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies . __eou__ How about ‘ Run of the Mill ? ’ __eou__ No . I heard that's really boring . __eou__ Why don't we go to a concert instead ? __eou__ Great idea ! __eou__
Hello , My name is Candy Brown . May I have your name ? __eou__ Hello , Candy . My name is Jim White . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from New Orleans . What about you ? __eou__ I was born here . __eou__ Really ? This is a beautiful town . __eou__ It's nice talking to you . But I have to go . __eou__ OK . Can I have your phone number ? __eou__ OK . It's 15066688866 . Call me ! Bye-bye , then . __eou__ I will . Bye . __eou__
It's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the weather sure is nice today . __eou__ I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? __eou__ That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . __eou__ I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . __eou__ Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . __eou__ Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? __eou__ I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . __eou__ If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . __eou__
I hear that you have been promoted . Congratulations on your promotion ! __eou__ Thank you , but I hate having to leave here and working abroad . __eou__ When are you going ? __eou__ Sometime next month . __eou__
I need your help , Bob . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . __eou__ Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . __eou__ A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ? __eou__ ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' __eou__ Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? __eou__ Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . __eou__ Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong . __eou__ Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . __eou__ Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . __eou__ Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize . __eou__
why are you in such a good mood today ? __eou__ well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights . __eou__ I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ? __eou__ let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . __eou__ so what did you do about it yesterday ? __eou__ I went sky-diving ! __eou__ you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! __eou__ It was scary , but it felt great , too . __eou__ weren't you scared ? __eou__ of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped . __eou__ so have you cured your fear of heights ? __eou__ I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly . __eou__ I'm impressed . __eou__ are you scared of anything ? __eou__ well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself . __eou__ what do you think is going to happen ? __eou__ I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things . __eou__ it sounds like you just need to be more careful . __eou__
Look out ! __eou__ What's it ? __eou__ You must have rolled over something just now . __eou__ What you said gives me the creeps ! __eou__
Mr . Green , I ’ d like to introduce you to Mr . Brown . __eou__ How do you do , Mr . Brown ? It ’ s a pleasure to get to know you . __eou__ My pleasure , Mr . Green . I look forward to an excellent relationship with your company . __eou__ I propose a toast to the health of everyone here and to the success of our negotiation . __eou__ Okay , let ’ s make a toast . __eou__
So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything . __eou__ Um ... Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO . Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot . He actually is the CEO now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with . __eou__ Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill ! __eou__ No kidding ! When the last CEO left , we were worried about the future of the company . __eou__ What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? __eou__ He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . He or she must give leadership to all company officers , as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company . __eou__ Must be one smart guy . __eou__
Okay , can I ask you something direct ? __eou__ Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . __eou__ Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? __eou__ No , seriously . . . I really want this . __eou__ I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . __eou__ I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
Have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ Yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . __eou__ Do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? __eou__ I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ No , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . __eou__ Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . __eou__ Did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? __eou__ Most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . __eou__ Wow , that must have really been scary . __eou__ Actually , some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . __eou__ Have you ever experiences a flood ? __eou__ No , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car ! __eou__ That sure didn't last long ! __eou__
There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . __eou__ What is a tornado warning ? __eou__ It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . __eou__ Really ? In New Berlin ? __eou__ No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . __eou__ I understand . They think a tornado might come . __eou__ Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch . __eou__ And the second stage is called a tornado warning . __eou__ Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . __eou__ It's scary . __eou__ Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . __eou__ What do you mean a loud train ? __eou__ That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . __eou__ But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? __eou__ Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . __eou__ Have you seen a lot of them ? __eou__ I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . __eou__ Did it hit their house ? __eou__ No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . __eou__ What were they doing when you called ? __eou__ They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . __eou__ That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? __eou__ Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . __eou__
Is this your brother-in-law ? __eou__ Yes , he married my sister ten years ago . __eou__ From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . __eou__ Yes , my sister loves his personality . __eou__
What about you , Ernie ? How did you get into pop music ? __eou__ Well I always hear it on the radio , so I started to get into it . __eou__ Yeah , if something is on the radio it must be really good . __eou__ I totally agree ! __eou__
Hello , Mary . Why are you standing here in the cold wind ? __eou__ I ’ m waiting for a bus and going for a walk in the park . __eou__ Going for a walk in such a cold weather ? __eou__ I always like to go for a walk before a supper . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Can you tell Bob from Tom ? __eou__ How can I ? They're as alike as two peas in a pod . __eou__ Don't you notice that Bob has a mole on his face , but Tom does not . __eou__ You really have keen eyes . __eou__
I have a problem . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ My mattress was supposed to be delivered today . __eou__ Is there a problem ? __eou__ The delivery people showed up four hours late . __eou__ I apologize for their tardiness . __eou__ I was late for work because of them . __eou__ Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__ I want my money back for the delivery . __eou__ Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . __eou__ It shouldn't be a problem . __eou__ I'm going to refund your money right now . __eou__
Hi , my name is Pete . You are Ann . Isn't that right ? __eou__ Hi Pete , how do you know my name ? __eou__ Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were . __eou__ Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ? __eou__ Yes , that's her . __eou__ I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ? __eou__ Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle . __eou__ Oh , I am from London as well . __eou__ Where in London do you live ? __eou__ In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually . Which is very nice because I love tennis . __eou__ I play tennis there every week . Shall we have a game one day ? __eou__ That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink . __eou__
Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . __eou__ Do you really think so ? __eou__ Yeah , you have some other ideas ? __eou__ Think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . __eou__ Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . __eou__
John got a heart attack last night . __eou__ Oh really ? Is he all right ? __eou__ Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time . __eou__ Poor old John ! I am ever so sorry . __eou__
Watch out ! You're too close to the fire place . __eou__ Don't worry , but my clothes are made of leathers . __eou__ Really ? That's wonderful ! __eou__ Thank you for your warning . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ Be careful of yourself . __eou__
You talked like the Terminator for two months ? Wow , I think you liked that movie even more than I liked ' Titanic . ' Why did you like ' Terminator ' so much ? __eou__ Well , ' Terminator ' is a really great action movie , and I like action movies because they're exciting . __eou__ Isn't ' Terminator ' really violent ? I usually don't like gory movies because they gross me out . __eou__ It is pretty violent , but since it's just robots fighting one another , it isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out . __eou__ Hmm ... I don't know . Even though it may not be gory , I think it would still totally freak me out . __eou__
So do you believe in palmistry ? __eou__ Palmistry ? What is that ? __eou__ It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future . __eou__ Oh , you mean palm reading 5 . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . __eou__ Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? __eou__ Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . __eou__ Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... __eou__ What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? __eou__ Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... __eou__ What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? __eou__ You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . __eou__ Hey ! __eou__
I heard through the grapevine that Michael probably become the new sales manager . __eou__ How did you get wind of the rumor ? __eou__ I am not a rumor monger . __eou__ Let ’ s stop gossiping and get back to work . __eou__

Her birthday is next week . __eou__ And when is your son's birthday ? __eou__ That is not for a while . His birthday is only in August . __eou__ But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon . __eou__ And when is your birthday ? __eou__ Oh , my birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers . __eou__ My birthday is in June , when we are always on holiday . So my family often forgets my birthday too . __eou__
Thank you very much for everything you have done for me during my stay in China . __eou__ And I must thank you again for your generous help . __eou__ The help is mutual . I must thank you to see me off . My wife and I will be looking forward to seeing you . You will come to see us , won't you ? __eou__ I promise I will take the first chance to call on you . Please send your wife with my best regards . __eou__
How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? __eou__ Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? __eou__ I like taking photos out of door . __eou__ Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . __eou__ Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . __eou__ You yourself have a photo studio ? __eou__ Yes , simple as it is . t does work . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , can I return this article , please ? __eou__ May I know the reason , madam ? __eou__ You see , I bought it for my husband , but he doesn't like it . __eou__ When did you buy it ? __eou__ Last Saturday . __eou__ Can I see the receipt ? __eou__ Yes , here you are . __eou__ Well , if there is no damage , you can return it . __eou__
hey , Lily , what are you doing ? __eou__ waiting for someone . __eou__ you mean the boy you met on MSN ? __eou__ you're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . __eou__ you must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! __eou__ I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . __eou__ I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . __eou__ well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . __eou__ did you tell him ? __eou__ yes . He said I'm his dream girl . __eou__ you shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . __eou__ I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice . __eou__ I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . __eou__
hi , Natasha , how's life ? __eou__ great . My family came to visit me . __eou__ oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . __eou__ I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . __eou__ I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? __eou__ yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . __eou__ interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da __eou__ do you get along well with each other ? __eou__ yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . __eou__ you are very lucky to have such a nice family . __eou__ thank you . __eou__
Is there a city where it's always warm ? __eou__ Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . __eou__ Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? __eou__ Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . __eou__ But why do so many people live there ? __eou__ Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . __eou__ Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? __eou__ Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . __eou__ Tell us about some cold cities . __eou__ In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . __eou__ Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? __eou__ Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . __eou__
Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . __eou__ Why would that be funny ? __eou__ Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . __eou__ I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . __eou__ What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . __eou__ Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . __eou__ What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . __eou__ Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , whatever . __eou__
You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout . __eou__ I ’ m not crazy about it at all . __eou__ You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? __eou__ I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . __eou__ I hate it . __eou__ Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . __eou__ It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . __eou__
Bye . Take care . __eou__ You too . __eou__
I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? __eou__ I think you'd better apologize . __eou__ Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . __eou__ Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . __eou__
Jack , what are you doing ? __eou__ I am reading . __eou__ I can see that . But why are you reading advertisements for houses for sale ? Are you buying a house ? __eou__ No , not yet . But I like to see what is available . __eou__ Can I have a look as well ? __eou__ Of course , have a seat . __eou__ Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful . __eou__ Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof . __eou__ Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top . __eou__ Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer . __eou__ Talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ? __eou__ Yes , next Saturday . I hope you can make it . __eou__
John , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ? __eou__ Sure . Have you checked the weather report ? __eou__ Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all . __eou__ I'd like some toast and chicken wings . __eou__ Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . __eou__ Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins , disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket . __eou__ That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . __eou__ Cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket . __eou__ Okay , it sounds good . __eou__
How ’ s your trip going ? __eou__ Oh I ’ m enjoying myself but it ’ s so hot here __eou__ Isn ’ t London hot in the summer ? __eou__ Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London . __eou__ I see . What about transport ? How does Shanghai compare to London ? __eou__ Actually I think the buses and trains here are more modern . __eou__ And what about the number of people on the streets ? __eou__ Oh , I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London . __eou__
Mom , can you talk about the philosophy of life with me ? __eou__ You got me on that one . __eou__
Do you like the Harry potter books and movies ? __eou__ Not really ! __eou__ Why not ? They are very fun and exiting . __eou__ Maybe , but I think they are just for kids . __eou__ No , that ’ s not true . Many adults like the Harry potter books too . __eou__ Maybe they don ’ t agree with my taste . __eou__
Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . __eou__ No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? __eou__ I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . __eou__ You must have a wonderful time . __eou__ Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? __eou__ No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . __eou__ Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ? __eou__
Hey , the pool's open now ! __eou__ As of today it is . Memorial Day marks the end of the school year and the beginning of summer . __eou__ So it's time for the kids to get outdoors ... __eou__ ... and for us to get tans in our new bikinis . __eou__ Not this Taiwanese girl . We don't like to get suntans . __eou__ That's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer . Hey , there's everybody ! We made it ! __eou__
Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night ! __eou__ You mean with my performance ? __eou__ Yes ! We have all assumed that you were the quiet , shy type . __eou__ I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve . __eou__ Where did you learn to sing like that ? __eou__ I was part of a band in school . __eou__ You ? Wow . And why don't you ever dress like that at work ? __eou__ Come on ! This is work . Don't you think that would be a little weird ? __eou__
Would you like to join the drama club ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Why do you want to join it ? __eou__ It's very exciting . I think . __eou__
Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ? __eou__ Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby ! __eou__ Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man ! __eou__ I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . __eou__ Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything . __eou__ Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? __eou__ Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! __eou__
Did you do anything fun over the weekend ? __eou__ I didn't want to go out last weekend , so I decided to stay at home and watch a movie . __eou__ Why didn't you want to go out ? __eou__ I was very tired after working all week . Sometimes on the weekend I don't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater . __eou__ Did you download a movie or rent it at the store ? __eou__ I downloaded it so that I didn't have to remember to return it . __eou__
I'm not a VIP . __eou__ You're too humble . __eou__
Is there a lot of crime in your city ? __eou__ There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime . __eou__ It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . __eou__ That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for our relatively low crime rate . __eou__ Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach . __eou__ I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . __eou__ That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . __eou__
I really should be on my way . __eou__ Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more . __eou__ No , thank you . I can ’ t . __eou__ It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . __eou__ Thank you very much . I had a really good time . __eou__ Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . __eou__ That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . __eou__ Anytime .

Bye ! Ben . __eou__
He said he will get married by the end of this month . __eou__ Big talk , I ’ d say . He does not have a girlfriend yet . __eou__ Who knows . After all , he is handsome and rich . __eou__
My son closed his ear to what I said . I don ’ t know what I should do . __eou__ You can twist his arm in order to have a control of him . __eou__ I cannot have the heart to do that . __eou__
I got a raise . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . __eou__
I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . __eou__ I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . __eou__ no-one really believes gossip columnists . __eou__ I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines . __eou__ I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? __eou__ I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . __eou__ You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography . __eou__ Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . __eou__
Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? __eou__ I ’ Ve cut it upland come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . __eou__ Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . __eou__ That ’ s why many people look up to him . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
do you mind if I sit here ? __eou__ no , of course not . Go ahead . __eou__ don't I know you ? __eou__ yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school . __eou__ you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time ! __eou__ What did you do after high school ? __eou__ I went straight to university afterwards . What about you ? __eou__ I took a year off to go travelling . __eou__ that sounds exciting . Where did you go ? __eou__ I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ? __eou__ I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department . __eou__ Oh , did you study a foreign language ? __eou__ yes , I got a grant to study Chinese . __eou__ that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ? __eou__ it is , but it's very rewarding . __eou__ so you can speak Chinese ? __eou__ I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die ! __eou__ I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well . __eou__
Hi , Mary , I didn't see you at work this morning . Are you all right ? __eou__ Oh , I feel miserable . I've got a bad cold , My head is dizzy and my nose is running . __eou__ Oh , I'm so sorry to hear that . Have you seen a doctor or taken any medicines ? __eou__ As a matter of fact I have , The doctor said it'll go away after a day or two.He ' s prescribed me some tablets . __eou__ Are you feeling better ? __eou__ Yes , it helps me but I just have to wait and let my system do the work . __eou__ Do you need anything , grocery ? __eou__ Oh , no , I'm fine.My refrigerator is piled up with food.But if it's not too much trouble for you . I'd like something to read . __eou__ Sure , I'll get it for you.Books or magazines ? __eou__ I'd like both . __eou__
Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . __eou__ I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? __eou__ I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . __eou__ I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . __eou__ It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . __eou__ You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . __eou__
I was thinking about applying for the new position . __eou__ Do you think that is a good idea ? __eou__ It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure . __eou__ What are your main concerns ? __eou__ Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job . __eou__ I know what you mean , I've thought about that myself . __eou__ I am also thinking about the pay . __eou__ Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward ? __eou__ Yes , it might be worth it . I am not certain . __eou__ I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you . __eou__
The murderer was sentenced to life imprisonment . __eou__ It ’ s severe punishment , I think . __eou__ Yeah , because he just killed a man in cold blood . __eou__ No wonder . __eou__
David , what have you been up to lately ? __eou__ I went on a trip with my family last week . __eou__ Really ? Where did you go ? __eou__ We went to Europe . __eou__ What cities did you go to ? __eou__ London , Paris and a few other cities . __eou__ Did you go to Berlin ? __eou__ No , We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time . __eou__ I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice . __eou__ That's what I've heard . __eou__ I went there last year . If you want , I can give you some information I have about the city . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? __eou__ Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__ Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__ Certainly , work always comes first . __eou__ But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . __eou__ Well , keep a low profile . __eou__
Have you started your report yet ? __eou__ I'm having a hard time getting the information . __eou__ It's easy . You only have to search the internet in order to get the information you're looking for . __eou__ Oh , I didn't think of that . __eou__

Where are you from , Laura ? __eou__ Well , my whole family is in the United States now , but we're from Costa Rica originally . __eou__ Oh , so you're from South America . __eou__ Actually , Costa Rica isn't in South America . It's in Central America . __eou__ Oh , right . My geography isn't very good ! __eou__
Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge . __eou__ Oh , How annoying ! __eou__ The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible . __eou__ It ’ s infuriating . I have to be in Rome by five . __eou__

Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . __eou__ OK . What are the biggest cities ? __eou__ The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . __eou__ OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? __eou__ I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . __eou__ Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? __eou__ Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . __eou__

You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner . __eou__ Yes , you are right .

The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ? __eou__ No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? __eou__ It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation .

Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ? __eou__ You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers . __eou__ Elvin doesn't want any programming help .

Let ' s got out tomorrow night . We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend . __eou__ I don ' t think that ' s a good idea . I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation . __eou__ Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines , you know , break the ice . __eou__ Pick-up lines don ' t work ! __eou__ Come on ! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \ ' d pick you first . ” __eou__ What ? Come on ! That ’ s just lame ! No girl would fall for that ! __eou__ Fine , then you can say , “ So there you are ! I ' Ve been looking all over for YOU , the woman of my dreams ! ” __eou__ That ' s a good one ! I think that ' s pretty funny . __eou__ Yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink . __eou__ Ok , how does this sound , “ I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there . So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ” __eou__ Nice ! Let ' s go ! __eou__
At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... __eou__ If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . __eou__ Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... __eou__ It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . __eou__ I guess I'd buy that ... __eou__
Did you go to the concert last weekend ? __eou__ No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . __eou__ How much was the ticket ? __eou__ I only paid two dollars for mine . __eou__
Great ! I landed on Classic Movies . __eou__ I didn't know you liked old movies . __eou__ I love them , especially the all-time greats like Gone With the Wind . __eou__ You're so right ! Today's movies are just too commercial ! __eou__ Sometimes I think Oscars are only awarded to movies that make a lot of money . __eou__
Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ? __eou__ Well , Brad from school asked me out just today . __eou__ Brad Bush ? Good for you ! __eou__ But I don't know what to do . __eou__ You mean you've never had a boyfriend ? __eou__ My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college . __eou__ Until college ? __eou__ Actually , that's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids . __eou__
Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . __eou__ Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? __eou__ You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . __eou__ So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . __eou__ I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? __eou__ One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . __eou__ It ’ s about time ! __eou__
Why are you in such a hurry ? __eou__ I should finish it as soon as possible . __eou__ Don't worry , do it step by step __eou__ Why can I learn it ? __eou__ Don't worry , do it step by step . __eou__ I feel I really stupid . __eou__
Hey , Frank , there is that Janet chick . __eou__ Wow , what a great burd ! __eou__ She sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__ She's a real turn-on , alright ? __eou__ And look out she's dressed . __eou__ Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . __eou__ No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . __eou__ Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . __eou__ I think you've lost it . __eou__ Well , that's my opinion . __eou__ I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . __eou__ Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . __eou__ At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . __eou__
Do you like swimming ? __eou__ Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . __eou__ Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . __eou__ I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . __eou__ Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? __eou__ Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . __eou__
You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . __eou__ Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__ Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__ I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . __eou__ You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . __eou__ Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . __eou__ At least you ’ re doing your part . My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family . __eou__ As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . __eou__
So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year . __eou__ Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ? __eou__ He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office . __eou__ Where will it be ? __eou__ We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . __eou__ Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ? __eou__ Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them . __eou__ Great . __eou__ Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile . __eou__ You seem excited about it . __eou__ Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team . __eou__ Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there . __eou__ Yes , I do . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market . __eou__ The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ? __eou__ It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial . __eou__ Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well.But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving . __eou__ That's very nice of you to say.But if we set up an office there in the States , maybe you could try to become part of it . __eou__ Me ? No way . I'm dedicated to the company , but I'm not going to leave Taiwan . I'm happy here . __eou__
How are the children doing at sport ? __eou__ I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . __eou__ He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? __eou__ He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi __eou__ Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? __eou__ The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . __eou__ How are they at swimming ? __eou__ They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . __eou__ Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . __eou__ I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! __eou__ I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . __eou__ It seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further . __eou__
How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . __eou__ That is a big family . How old is your sister ? __eou__ 15 . __eou__ What about your brother ? __eou__ He ’ s not quite 25 . __eou__ Do you miss your family ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Do you often go home ? __eou__ No . But I write to them often . __eou__ How often do you write to them ? __eou__ Once a month . __eou__
Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . __eou__ You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . __eou__ Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? __eou__ The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . __eou__ Wow ! What a hit ! __eou__ Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . __eou__ Is he ok ? __eou__ It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . __eou__ I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . __eou__ The Giants ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , here we go again . __eou__ What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? __eou__ The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . __eou__
Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ? __eou__ If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln . __eou__ He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ? __eou__ That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals . __eou__ That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected . __eou__ And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights . __eou__ He had great vision , didn't he ? __eou__ And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally . __eou__
What ’ s your working day like ? __eou__ I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . __eou__ Do you get paid onetime ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . __eou__ Do you have any breaks ? __eou__ We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . __eou__ My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . __eou__ I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it . __eou__
Freeze ! __eou__ Don't shoot . I give up . __eou__
You know that ? Dan got a divorce . __eou__ Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much . __eou__ Yeah . But his relation with Sallycome to a sticky end and was found by his wife . __eou__ He deserved it . __eou__
Hello , is Jack there ? __eou__ Speaking . __eou__ Jack ! It ’ s Rose here . __eou__ Hi , Rose . How ’ s everything ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . I ’ m having several friends over for dinner this Saturday . And I was wondering if you have the time to join us . __eou__ Sounds good . What time do you want me to come ? __eou__ Is six o ’ clock okay ? __eou__
Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? __eou__ Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty . My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . __eou__ Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . __eou__ Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . __eou__ I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! __eou__ He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__ Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . __eou__ How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? __eou__ Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? __eou__ Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... __eou__ ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... __eou__ Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? __eou__ Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . __eou__ Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . __eou__ The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! __eou__
What's the time now ? __eou__ Sorry , I don't know , there's something wrong with my watch . __eou__ You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ? __eou__ In the coming , before going to work . __eou__ You got up so late today . You have , I think . Turn on the TV and set your watch by it . __eou__ OK . I'll turn it on . __eou__ All right . It's just four o'clock . __eou__ Well , I'm setting my watch at four . Thank you . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . __eou__ That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? __eou__ I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend . __eou__ I'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__ Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . __eou__
Whose part do you think is best played ? __eou__ That of the old man . __eou__ You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . __eou__ Some of the scenes moved me into tears . __eou__
We're having a tailgate party I before the game . Would you like to join us ? __eou__ Okay . But what is a tailgate party ? __eou__ Someone brings a truck to the game and we have a barbecue right there in the parking lot out of the back of the truck ! __eou__ How fun ! Can I bring something ? __eou__ Don't worry about it ! Just come at five . __eou__ I make a mean potato salad ! __eou__ Well , if you insist , you are welcome to bring a potato salad ! __eou__ Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five ! Thank you ! __eou__
What may I do for you ? __eou__ I need to get a passport . __eou__ You will need to apply for one . __eou__ When will I be able to do that ? __eou__ You can do it right now , if you ’ d like . __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__ Please fill out this application . __eou__ Then what do I do ? __eou__ I just need to take your picture . __eou__ How long will it take for my passport to be ready ? __eou__ You will get it in a few weeks . __eou__ That ’ s perfect . __eou__
I ’ Ve got this really neat idea , you can hire a car and drive straight there . __eou__ Are you nuts ? What would my friends think if they see me in a hired car ? __eou__ But that ’ s the quickest way to make your plans work . __eou__ Oh this is hard ! Well , I ’ ll see what I can do . __eou__
Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it . __eou__ You do ? OK , fine with me . __eou__ Thank you SO much . __eou__ But I also want ya to do me a favor . __eou__ What ? __eou__ You gotta have some better deodorant . __eou__ I ’ m sorry ? ! __eou__
I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away . __eou__ I knew this would happen some day . __eou__ Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ? __eou__ Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too . __eou__ I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life ! __eou__ I think we can still talk . __eou__ No way ! Please don't follow me around . __eou__ Talk it easy , Anna . You really don't hate me . do you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Leave me alone ! __eou__
It's a fine day today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . __eou__ How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . __eou__ I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time . __eou__ Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year . __eou__ You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow . __eou__ Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain . __eou__ The weatherman predicts a fine day today . __eou__ The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . __eou__
When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? __eou__ Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . __eou__ How about Sunday then ? __eou__ Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? __eou__ Does 6 thirty suit you ? __eou__ It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . __eou__ Thanks , goodbye . __eou__
Hey , look ! They ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 Olympics . __eou__ Isn ’ t that Michael Johnson ? I think he set a world record in this race . __eou__ He completed the first 200 / 400 double in Olympic history ! __eou__ Are you sure ? What about Carl Lewis ? He won four golds , didn ’ t he ? __eou__ Carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 . __eou__ I like the way Carl runs . He looks more graceful . __eou__
Will you have time this Saturday evening to go to the cinema with me ? __eou__ Saturday ? Oh , I have a previous engagement . __eou__ What a pity ! Then how about Sunday ? __eou__ I've already got plans , too . __eou__ Then when do you think we could go out together ? __eou__ How about Friday ? Only in that day can I arrange it . __eou__ OK . Any time on Friday will be OK with me . __eou__ That's settled then . I'll contact you later . __eou__
Come on , fellows.Let ' s enjoy my wife's cooking ! __eou__ Em , it's delicious ! __eou__ Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much . __eou__ You're lucky . __eou__
Guess what ! __eou__ What ? __eou__ I am going to the mountains with my family this weekend . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__
Does Mr . Schmidt know he's going to become a father ? __eou__ No , and I have no way of getting ahold of him ! There's no phone where he's at ! __eou__ Well , he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back , doesn't he ! __eou__ My older sister Judy will be here soon to help . She already has a boy and a girl of her own ... __eou__ I just saw a red van pulling into the driveway . Is that her ? __eou__
B , what's in your hand ? __eou__ Sunday papers . I usually read them after coming back home from our company . __eou__ Why do you read them ? __eou__ As you know , I am a sports fan . And these papers are famous for their sports section . So I will feel relaxed after grasping some information I am interested in . __eou__ I got your meaning . Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks . __eou__ Correct ! What about you , Fred ? __eou__ I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired . I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste . __eou__ Don't overdo it . __eou__ Shall we have a drink someday ? __eou__ I get drunk easily . __eou__
What a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's nice and bright . __eou__ I hope it stays like this . __eou__ I hope so too . __eou__ Is the weather usually like this here ? __eou__ It's usually a bit hotter than today . __eou__ What's the weather like in winter ? __eou__ It's pretty cold and it often snows . __eou__ I wonder what it ’ s going to be like tomorrow . __eou__ Let's hear the weather report later . What's the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ Neither too cold , nor too hot . __eou__ That's quite a lovely weather . __eou__ Yes , especially in spring . __eou__ Have you ever seen a hurricane ? __eou__ Once , when I was a child . __eou__ Do they often happen in your country ? __eou__ Now and then . __eou__ Oh , it's time for the weather reporter . Let's turn on the TV . __eou__
Are you travelling in America ? __eou__ No , I am on business . I will spend half a month for the business . __eou__ What do you do ? __eou__ I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman . __eou__ I know all the tricks of the trade . It is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted . __eou__ Maybe . But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience . What about you ? __eou__ I am a reporter at a TV station . __eou__ Do you like your job ? __eou__ Yes , I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year . __eou__ Which kind of news do you catch ? __eou__ I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades . __eou__ Are you feel tired ? __eou__ Sometimes . News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing . __eou__ You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter . __eou__ That's right . I am still wet behind the ears . __eou__
What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city . __eou__ I'm glad you like it.The bell is on the bedside.Just ring if you want anything.The room attendant speaks a little English.So I don't think you'll have any trouble . __eou__ No , I shouldn't think so.By the way , is there a socket for my razor ? __eou__ I think so.Here it is.It ' s by the basin . __eou__ Is it a two-pin socket ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . __eou__
You're my hero . __eou__ Aw , shucks , ma'am . __eou__
That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from . __eou__ Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning . __eou__ I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today . __eou__ But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil . __eou__ A match made in heaven . __eou__
What ’ s your city like ? __eou__ It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . __eou__ Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? __eou__ Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ What about restaurants and entertainment ? __eou__ There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many s __eou__ Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? __eou__ There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . __eou__ It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . __eou__ It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . __eou__
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? __eou__ I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__ you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__ I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__ you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you __eou__ a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__ then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__ I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . __eou__
When ’ re you getting married ? __eou__ We planned our wedding for next May . __eou__ Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ? __eou__ Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project . __eou__ That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ? __eou__ Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . __eou__ Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . __eou__
Good afternoon , Mrs . Brown . I've come to see Mr . Brown . __eou__ Good afternoon , Mr . Green . __eou__ Is he in ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but he's not in , he's gone out on business . __eou__ Oh ! I just drop in on him for a chat . __eou__ Please come in for a cup of coffee . __eou__ No , thank you . Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . __eou__
I heard the film was after the novel The Godfather . __eou__ Who wrote it ? __eou__ Mario Puku . __eou__ Who're the producer , the director , the stars , heroine and the hero ? __eou__ I'm always interested in how , but seldom pay much attention to who . __eou__
Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . __eou__ That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ? __eou__ I'd love it . Working out is more fun with a friend . __eou__ I'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__ Good . If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . __eou__
You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are ! __eou__ Give me a chance to explain . I was no my way and I had an accident . __eou__ Sure . You look like you're all black and blue . __eou__ I am fine . In fact , I don't have a scratch on me or my vehicle . But the other guy is in critical condition . __eou__ You're serious ? __eou__ Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert . __eou__ I guess I misjudged you . I hope you can forgive me . __eou__ Of course I forgive you . What are friends for ? Now , what am I going to do for that other guy ? __eou__
The whether in Beijing is just beautiful . __eou__ Autumn is the best season in Beijing you know ? __eou__ Yes . I can see . The summer heat is over . And the winter cold is still far away . __eou__ What is the whether like in Washington at this time of this year ? __eou__ Autumn is also very nice In Washington . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter there ? __eou__ No . it isn ’ t .

I ’ m from the north . I was born in Beijing actually . __eou__ I see . So this is your hometown ? __eou__

Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . __eou__ Yeah , the government really takes a bit , doesn't it ? __eou__ Seriously . The only tax I don't mind them taking is social security . It's only a few dollars every paycheck . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? __eou__ Yeah . It won't be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . __eou__ Yeah , my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . __eou__ Let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it . __eou__ Really ? No , they couldn't . None of them would have jobs if they did . __eou__
Nick ! How ’ s it going ? __eou__ Oh , hey ... __eou__ What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ? __eou__ Actually , my office is right around the corner . __eou__ It was great to meet you last week at the conference .

Is that a new restaurant or something ? __eou__ Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat . __eou__ How did you get involved in something like that ? __eou__ Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop . __eou__ So what do you do there ? __eou__ It's simple . All we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen . __eou__ Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ? __eou__ Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ? __eou__ I don't know . I mean , I like helping the community and all that , but I don't know if I have the time ... __eou__ Come on , it's easy , and it'll make you feel good . Why don't you come with me tonight ? __eou__

Man , I knew you weren ’ t listening to me . __eou__ You ’ re right . I wasn ’ t . I hear nothing . __eou__ Nothing ? __eou__ Not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart , I think that ’ s how it goes , something like that . __eou__ You and Patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? You can tell me . __eou__ Engaged ? __eou__ Come on . __eou__ Are you crazy ? __eou__ What ? I thought you liked Patricia . __eou__
I'll come see you tomorrow . __eou__ Promise ? __eou__

A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form .

I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too . __eou__ I ’ Ve brought a tape with lots of children ’ s songs on it . __eou__ Hopefully , that will keep everyone happy . __eou__

There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month . __eou__ What kind of food will they be serving ? __eou__ My favorite , Mexican .

I feel very hungry now . __eou__ Fine , I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . Shall we try that one ? __eou__ Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work . __eou__
Charlotte , have you had your supper ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t want to eat anything . __eou__ Why ? Don't you feel well ? __eou__ I ’ m down in spirits . __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ My manager jumped on me for my mistake today . __eou__ You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing . __eou__ I think I'm too clumsy . I can do nothing well . __eou__ You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done . __eou__ But I doubt myself . __eou__ Cheer up ! Don't let me down . We all make mistakes , and that is life . __eou__
I'm afraid I can't go to the pictures with you tomorrow . __eou__ Busy with your work again ? __eou__ Not really . I'm expected to attend a meeting . __eou__ I'm not at all convinced . Tomorrow is Saturday ! __eou__

I'm so glad to meet you . __eou__ How is everything going on ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ You look prettier than before . __eou__ Really ? Thank you . __eou__
You must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ? __eou__ Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it . __eou__ It ’ s a sad thing . I ’ m ever so sorry ... __eou__ Are you done ? __eou__
Hello , Rebecca , fancy meeting you here ! __eou__ Hi , Paul . I haven't seen you for a long time . __eou__ How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thank you , and you ? __eou__ Pretty good . What brings you here ? __eou__ I came to see my uncle . He lives in the next block . __eou__
What courses are you going to take next year ? __eou__ Well , I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics , but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet . I'd like to take English . __eou__ Why are you going to take english with chemistry and physics ? __eou__ Because I want to study english literature . but I think chemistry is better for getting a job . __eou__ Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college . Have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated ? __eou__ I am going to be a , well , I hope to be a research chemist . __eou__
Hi , chary , are you busy this evening ? __eou__ sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight . __eou__ what are you doing ? __eou__ I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday . __eou__ how old is he today ? __eou__ it's his 50th birthday . __eou__ well , wish him a happy birthday for me . __eou__ sure thing .

It's about time I made a move . __eou__ say hello to your friends for me . __eou__ likewise . See you later . __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Good afternoon ! __eou__ Hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . I am Wang Lin . __eou__ Glad to meet you , Wang Lin . I am Mary . __eou__ Is this your first time in Beijing ? __eou__ Yes . My company has an office here , and I have just been transferred . __eou__ Here is my phone number . If you need anyone to show you around , call me . __eou__ Great . I would like that . __eou__
Hey Michelle , jump in quick . It's pouring out there ! __eou__ Oh , hi Melissa . Are you going to the conference too ? I was planning to pick up Mr . Campbell . __eou__ Yes , he told me . We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference . __eou__ Oh I see , okay . So I heard you got married . Congratulations ! __eou__ Ah thank you ! I'm very excited . We were going to get married next year , but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . It was wonderful . __eou__ That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . We just don't have the money ! __eou__ I know what you mean . I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive , don't you ? __eou__ I sure do . In my opinion , it's actually becoming more expensive than back home . __eou__ Definitely . Oh , there's Mr . Campbell . Driver , can you stop here please ? __eou__
What's that , a new video game ? __eou__ Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do . __eou__ For instance ? __eou__ It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer . __eou__ Wow ! Anything else ? __eou__ This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen . __eou__ What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies ? __eou__ Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go ! __eou__
Hey , what's up ? __eou__ Oh , nothing . __eou__ What were you writing ? __eou__ ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . __eou__ You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! __eou__ I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . __eou__ But , you work with her everyday . __eou__ That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . __eou__ You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? __eou__ Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . __eou__ Well , I guess you don't want this note , then . __eou__ What note ? __eou__ I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . __eou__ You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . __eou__ Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? __eou__ Yeah , I want the note . __eou__ Have a great time tomorrow night . __eou__ Thanks . I plan on it . __eou__
So , what happened ? __eou__ He never came . __eou__ He stood you up . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? __eou__ Not possible . __eou__ Maybe , there was a subway accident . __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ A train got trapped underground with him inside . __eou__ And no phone . __eou__ And you know , how those express trains create suction . __eou__
Mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ It's OK . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ He is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__ Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? __eou__ He didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__ Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__ Oh , David . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What should I do if he doesn't call me ? __eou__ Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . __eou__ Thank you , David . You're always so encouraging . __eou__ That's what friends are for . __eou__
I feel terrible , but I've just broken your ashtray . __eou__ It's nothing to get upset about . __eou__ I don't know what to say . I'd like to replace it . __eou__ No . It's out of the question . __eou__
I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike . __eou__ What's the big deal ? __eou__
The hotel is full tonight . we will need to find a new place to stay . __eou__ Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . I've been wanting to try a new place anyway . __eou__
Do you know much about computers ? __eou__ Not a great deal . __eou__ I've just been reading an article about them.they ' ll be used for all sorts of things now . __eou__ For accounting system and things like that , you mean ? __eou__ Yes , but they are used for other things , too.Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . __eou__ Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__ Fred is really a good guy . And he loves you so much . __eou__ Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife . __eou__ He's after your own heart , it is important . __eou__ So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday . __eou__ I promise ! __eou__
Many happy returns of the day , darling ? __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ And here is your birthday present . __eou__ A gold watch ! __eou__ Do you like it ? __eou__ I love it ! Darling , you ’ re kind . __eou__
I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . __eou__ Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . __eou__ You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . __eou__ I'm sure of what I'm doing . __eou__
Hi Jane , you look great . __eou__ You too . Have you lost some weight ? __eou__ Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . __eou__ Not some crazy diet fat I hope . __eou__ No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . __eou__ Good for you , keep it up . __eou__
On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . __eou__ Yes , it's to my liking , too . __eou__ Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? __eou__ It's my dream . __eou__
Hi , Sue . What's up ? __eou__ Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? __eou__ Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . __eou__ Really ? What's he been doing ? __eou__ You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . __eou__ Are you ? What are you busy with ? __eou__ Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . __eou__
OK , that ’ s fine . Bye . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move . __eou__ What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? __eou__ The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot __eou__ Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP . __eou__ I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . __eou__ Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out . __eou__ Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? __eou__ Hehe .. sure __eou__
Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? __eou__ I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . __eou__ How would you solve the problem ? __eou__ I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . __eou__ It would probably be very expensive . __eou__ I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement . __eou__ It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . __eou__ If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . __eou__ Most voters what everything bout ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . __eou__ The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . __eou__ Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly . __eou__
The sun is shining . __eou__ But there're some mare's tails . __eou__ That's the sign of wind . __eou__ Oh , really , I thought it was a sign of rain . __eou__
Hello , Joanna . You are looking very charming in the new dress . __eou__ Thanks . Does it suit me ? __eou__ Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve seen anything like it before . __eou__ I know . That ’ s why I bought it . I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing . __eou__ And the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously . __eou__ It ’ s very nice of you to say so . I should say you are glamorous yourself , as a matter of fact . __eou__ Thank you for saying so . __eou__
Welcome back ! How was your vacation ? __eou__ It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! __eou__ Where did you end up going ? __eou__ Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . __eou__ I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? __eou__ That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? __eou__ Sure . What's this one a picture of ? __eou__ Oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . __eou__ You don't look very happy in that picture . __eou__ No , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! __eou__ So what did you do ? __eou__ We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . __eou__ My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? __eou__ Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . __eou__ That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . __eou__
Your ring is very beautiful . __eou__ Thank you . It has been handed down in my family for three generations . __eou__ Oh , it is precious . __eou__ It surely is . __eou__
Our major is from a bigger city . __eou__ He ’ s doing fine . A new broom sweeps clean . __eou__ He brings with him some talented people from his former city . __eou__ I think we ’ ll benefit a lot . __eou__
Hey , where's Cindy ? __eou__ She told me that she's got tennis practice today . __eou__ You're Mary , right ? __eou__ How did you know ? __eou__ Cindy told me about you in our gym class . __eou__ I see . Do you live in this neighborhood , too ? __eou__ My house is next door to yours . __eou__ Oh , Cindy did mention you before . You're Alexander Newman . __eou__ Just call me Alex . Alex and Alexander are the same thing . __eou__
What's the score ? __eou__ The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half . __eou__ The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final . __eou__ It doesn't seem to be so easy . __eou__
I hear that there is a festival called Duanwu in China . __eou__ Yes . It is also called Dragon Boat Festival . __eou__ Why are you celebrating this festival ? __eou__ We celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of China — Qu Yuan . __eou__ What do you do on that day ? __eou__ We'll have rice dumplings . What's more , there are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Hey , there's Leo . I wonder why he's walking arm in arm with that young woman . __eou__ It's as plain as the nose on your face . They're dating each other . __eou__ You're pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! __eou__ Well , you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan . __eou__ It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week . __eou__ I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . __eou__
How many credits are you taking this semester ? __eou__ I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant . But so far , I only have fifteen . __eou__ What's the matter , are the classes you want full ? __eou__ Yes . And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major . __eou__ If you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ? __eou__ I think with International Business a language would be appropriate . __eou__ Have you even thought that far ahead ? I mean what country would you like to do business with ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , I would like to work in South America . So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work . __eou__
What part did you get in the play this time ? __eou__ I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes . __eou__ I wish I had a character part . Those are my favorite . __eou__ Are you kidding ? You got the leading role . __eou__ I know , but I've done that so Ay times . It's getting old . The leading guy is always the same macho A . __eou__ I would trade you if I could but I don't think I'd be a very convincing macho A . __eou__ Next time . You are going to love your part . I've seen the script . __eou__ I do a good old lady . I wouldn't mind being the damsel in distress once in a while . __eou__
Are you free on Friday evening because we were wondering if you would like to come round for dinner ? __eou__ Oh , thank you very much .

I ’ Ve got a lot going on the next couple of weeks . Why don ’ t I call you later ? __eou__ Okay , that ’ s fine . __eou__
Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? __eou__ I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . __eou__ How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? __eou__ Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . __eou__
Great party , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , really , jane and ted always have great parties . __eou__ This is my first , I only met jane last week . she and I teach at the same school . __eou__ Oh , so you're a teacher . __eou__ Yeah , history , what about you ? __eou__ I'm in the car business . __eou__ Salesman ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Oh , I see , by the way , my name's Mary . __eou__ Nice to meet you , I'm jim taylor . __eou__

Quickly ! __eou__ So , since when is your house a bank ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows . __eou__ Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . __eou__ What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? __eou__ Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . __eou__ OK , well , what did you want to see me about ? __eou__ You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful ! __eou__
You didn't ring me last night.You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn'y mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
Hey ! What's up ? __eou__ Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . __eou__ Yeah , I've been out of town . __eou__ So how have you been ? __eou__ Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . __eou__
Hey , let's go to the night market after work tonight . __eou__ That's a good idea . I haven't been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! __eou__ That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . __eou__
Reciting texts really bores me to death . __eou__ Do you have to remember every text ? __eou__ Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good . __eou__
Good Lord ! Look at that man . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ He's swimming in the cold sea . He must be very strong . __eou__ Sure he is . Winter swimming does good to health , I hear . __eou__
How about a movie tonight ? __eou__ It doesn't matter to me . __eou__ Does 7 o'clock suit you ? __eou__ Either way . I don't care . __eou__ How about a snack after work ? __eou__ I couldn't careless . __eou__ Would you rather stay home ? __eou__ Whatever you say . __eou__ Are you really interested in doing something ? __eou__ I don't mind if you want to . __eou__
Have you bought another handset __eou__ No , it is the original one . __eou__ This is silver gray , while I remember your handset was black . __eou__ I have changed a case for it . __eou__ Can a handset case be changed ? __eou__ Of course . That's why I bought this type . I can change its case frequently , so it is novel to use it . __eou__ How many cases are accessible ? __eou__ There are two more , one is orange and the other is pink . I have bought them all . __eou__ It's really going to be fresh all the time . __eou__
Would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ I'd love to go out with you , but I'm sorry I'm busy tonight , but I'd like a rain check . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I want to change my job . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I want to earn more . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Not only that . The job I ’ m doing now is the most boring job you can imagine . __eou__
It's very cold tonight ! __eou__ Can I get you another blanket ? __eou__ 0h , that would be nice of you . __eou__ I'll turn the heat up . __eou__ Yes , please do that . __eou__
Do bullfights interest you much ? __eou__ Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . __eou__ So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__
There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it . __eou__ I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ? __eou__ ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . __eou__ I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess . __eou__ Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? __eou__ Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . __eou__ Those young actors play the roles perfectly . __eou__ I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ? __eou__ No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it . __eou__ Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . __eou__
Would you like to come out with me tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I can ’ t . __eou__ Tomorrow night , then ? __eou__ I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . __eou__ I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . __eou__ That ’ s sounds great . __eou__ Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? __eou__ No . I ’ d better not . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . __eou__
You look like a basket case . __eou__ I'm not surprised . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ My brother in-law just dropped in from the states . __eou__ Yeah , and ? __eou__ I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake ! __eou__ Why ? __eou__ He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . __eou__ I guess you think twice next time he comes . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__ So how long has he here for ? __eou__ Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming . __eou__ Well , I know you do the right thing . __eou__
Hi , Mrs . Henderson . __eou__ Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ? __eou__ Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ? __eou__ The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ? __eou__ No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ? __eou__ I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary . __eou__ Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip . __eou__ OK . I close my mouth . __eou__
What's up , buddy ? You look so upset . __eou__ I just broke up with a girl . Why didn't she understand that I loved her ? __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . What's your conflict ? __eou__ I don't know . She always said I didn't love her , but I did . __eou__ Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call . __eou__ I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet . __eou__ Come on , guy . Maybe she isn't your right person . __eou__
I like your sweater . It suits you very well . __eou__ Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend . __eou__ She certainly has the taste . __eou__
Mr . : There are two things that you'll need to know . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ Mr . : The school has three lunch periods , and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch . __eou__ Wow ! __eou__ Mr . : Furthermore , when you are dismissed in the afternoon , you will be divided into two waves . __eou__ Two waves ? __eou__ Mr . : The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time . So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students . __eou__ And the other half come in later to pick up the second wave . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__ What ? What did you buy ? __eou__ It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__ What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ And ? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ And it's a brick ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . __eou__ Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__
I'm sorry for being late . __eou__ You're supposed to stand here quietly until the flag - raising ceremony is over . __eou__ About what time can I go to my own class ? __eou__ When everything is over . __eou__ Now that it is all over . can I go now ? __eou__ Not yet . You should stand still for another few minutes . Late-comers must be recorded . __eou__ That's too bad ! __eou__
Are you looking forward to seeing that big concert next week ? __eou__ You bet . I'm really excited . __eou__
Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? __eou__ I'm just watching some television . __eou__ I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . __eou__ Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? __eou__ I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . __eou__ That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? __eou__ That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . __eou__ I like to play the piano for fun . __eou__ Yeah . That can be a good hobby . __eou__ Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . __eou__ That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . __eou__
Have you had any kind of punishment in your college ? __eou__ Yes , but it was many years ago . __eou__ What was it for ? __eou__ I was a naughty boy and I played hooky . So the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week . __eou__
How do you like my new sports car ? __eou__ It's cool . __eou__
If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . __eou__ Would you ? I wouldn't . __eou__ What would you do ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . __eou__ One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . __eou__ Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? __eou__ As I said , I'd go round the world . __eou__ What would you do after that ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . __eou__ It doesn't sound very exciting . __eou__ Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ? __eou__ I'd be happy if I got a rise . __eou__ And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . __eou__ Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . __eou__ What'll you have ? __eou__ I'll have a pint of the best . __eou__ I'd have a Scotch if I were you . We deserve it . __eou__ All right . Make it a double , will you ? __eou__
do you like animals ? I really like dogs . __eou__ so do i . I don ’ t like cats . __eou__ why ? I think cats are ok . __eou__ I can ’ t bear being near cats . They don ’ t seem to like me either . __eou__ I like wild animals . I don ’ t like spiders and snakes . I think spiders and snakes are disgusting . __eou__ I ’ m fond of snakes . I think they ’ re great . I agree with you about spiders though . I think spiders are horrible . I think it ’ s because they have so many legs . __eou__ I think bears are wonderful . Pandas are fantastic . I low the people who kill them for their fur . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m carry about mice . I think they ’ re so cute ! __eou__ really ? I don ’ t see the attraction . I ’ m afraid of mice . __eou__
I hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ? __eou__ Yeah , it happened a week ago . __eou__ That's a crying shame . It really is ! __eou__ Fortunately , she's not seriously injured . __eou__
Good evening , I'm so happy you could come . __eou__ Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ What would you like to drink ? __eou__ A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you . __eou__
My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that . __eou__ What does his dad say ? __eou__ John is a peacemaker.He simply doesn ’ t bother.He says he should give him a free hand . __eou__
Do you think children watch too much Tv ? __eou__ I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . __eou__ Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much Tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . __eou__ If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . __eou__ They could go out and play with their friends . __eou__ Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . __eou__ Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much Tv too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much Tv , the kids will probably follow suit . __eou__
Did you meet the new girl in our sales department . She is taking the place of Maggie during her alternative leave . __eou__ Did they finally fill that post , how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet . __eou__ I guess not , They haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet , she barely started yesterday . __eou__ Is she just working temporarily ? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave . __eou__ If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes . __eou__
what's up ? __eou__ not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline . __eou__ Are you using dial-up or broadband ? __eou__ actually , I've got a wireless connection . __eou__ In that case , you need to turn on your airport . __eou__ I hook up to the Internet every day . I can't believe I didn't do that . __eou__ do you like ever chat online ? __eou__ No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? __eou__ Oh , no . You can register for free . Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it . __eou__ what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them ? __eou__ well , you can always block them . When I don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what I do . __eou__ what's your email address ? I'll add you to my contacts list . __eou__ it's aubreyinchina@yahoo.com . __eou__ cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help . __eou__ don't mention it . __eou__
I ran into a glass door yesterday . __eou__ What a bone head ! Be careful next time . __eou__
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? __eou__ Yeah , about . __eou__ Do you know Chinese better now ? __eou__ Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . __eou__ Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . __eou__ I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . __eou__ A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . __eou__ I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . __eou__ Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . __eou__ Yes , absolutely true . __eou__
That guy's manner really turns me off . __eou__ Yeah.He never stops asking questions . __eou__ Maybe he's abnormal . __eou__
Do you like our new history teacher ? __eou__ I'm fed up with his endless talking . __eou__ You can't say that ! He's a very knowledgeable person . __eou__ I can't see it . __eou__
Have you seen Harry ? __eou__ No . As far as I can remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to Lisbon . __eou__ Yes , but he was supposed to be back by now . __eou__ Maybe you'll call his home . __eou__
You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English . __eou__ Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ? __eou__ What's your method of learning ? __eou__ Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice . __eou__ What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? __eou__ Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , than the other . __eou__ That's a good idea . You are really creative . __eou__
How's your new car ? __eou__ Perfect.Couldn ' t be better ! __eou__ You made a good choice , then ? __eou__ It's just what I wanted . __eou__ No regrets ? __eou__ I'm really pleased with it.Thanks . __eou__ I'm glad you're so happy . __eou__ It's super . __eou__
Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed . __eou__ Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person . __eou__ It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties . __eou__ I don't go to parties . The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house . Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in . I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen . __eou__ Then fans don't see you much in public places . __eou__ Yes . I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life . I love what I do and I love how I spend my time , which isn't in a public place . __eou__ A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts . I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' Well , they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . ' __eou__ I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses . __eou__
When do children start school in your country ? __eou__ Normally at six . Before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center . __eou__ But thats only in the cities , isnt it ? __eou__ Right . In the countryside , things are more complicated . __eou__ Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ? __eou__ It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school . __eou__
The baby is crying again . __eou__ Leave him alone , he ’ ll soon stop . __eou__ How can you do so ? Perhaps something is wrong with him . Let ’ s go and see him . __eou__ OK . Nothing serious . He just wants us to be with him . __eou__
Oh that ’ s a lovely necklace . __eou__ Thank you . My husband gave it to me . __eou__ Oh I didn ’ t know you were married . __eou__ Yes I am . I got married five years ago . __eou__ Oh I see . That ’ s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ? __eou__ No , we met at university . __eou__
Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice . __eou__ Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet . __eou__ Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ? __eou__ This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee ! __eou__ That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? __eou__ No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . __eou__ So , what programs do you have on your laptop ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs . __eou__ I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime ! __eou__ It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ? __eou__
Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . __eou__ How are you these days ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . And you ? __eou__ Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week . __eou__
What's happening in your life ? __eou__ Can you believe I'm going to America ? __eou__ That sounds great . __eou__ Yes , I'm really excited . __eou__
My wife is really a chatter box . It ’ s so boring . __eou__ I have an idea . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ You just turn a deaf ear when she talks . __eou__
You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen . __eou__ So are you . __eou__ And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . __eou__ I feel exactly the same way as you . __eou__ Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse . __eou__ What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either . __eou__ You don ’ t love me ? __eou__ No . __eou__ But we ’ re so right for each other . __eou__ I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann . __eou__
My elder aunt feels like vomiting , she is pregnant . __eou__ She'd better drink plenty of hot water and lie in bed . __eou__ But she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day . __eou__ Don't worry . She will be all right . __eou__
Is this your umbrella , miss ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now . __eou__ You look a bit familiar to me . I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before . __eou__ Have you ? __eou__ May I ask where you live ? __eou__ Just two blocks away , in that tall building . __eou__ That ’ s it . I live there , too . I live on the sixth floor . __eou__ My family move in just two weeks ago . We live on the fourth floor . __eou__ It ’ s a small world ! May I know your name , miss ? __eou__ I ’ m Chen Ming . __eou__ How do you do , Miss Chen ? I ’ m Song Mei . __eou__ I ’ m glad to meet you , Mr . Song . __eou__ Are you going to your office now , Miss Chen ? __eou__ No , I ’ m going to the airport to meet some friends from Beijing . __eou__
It's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding . __eou__ How can I forget my old friend ? __eou__ My best wishes to you and the bride ! __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals . __eou__ A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people . __eou__ That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now . __eou__ Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people . __eou__ why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy . __eou__ Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . __eou__ They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . __eou__ I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . __eou__ Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . __eou__ To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . __eou__ You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . __eou__ That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . __eou__ You really can't live without candy . __eou__
Who do you think will win the championship ? __eou__ I really can't say . Both teams this year seem really good . __eou__ There's a game on tonight . You want to watch it with me ? __eou__ That sounds great ! __eou__
Good morning miss . Wang __eou__ Good morning Mr . Li __eou__ It ’ s a beautiful morning isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Oh . It ’ s a nice day indeed __eou__ I hope it won ’ t be too hot , I can ’ t stand the heat __eou__ Really . For me too . __eou__
You are very late , but I was on pins and needles the whole time . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . __eou__
Look at these newlyweds . They seem as if they are on top of the world . __eou__ Yes , they do . It's great for them to tie the knot and get married . __eou__ People who have just got married feel that the world is right before them . __eou__ Nothing seems to be happier for them . __eou__
What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ? __eou__ I ’ d say , think twice about it . Well , you are not going to quit school , are you ? __eou__ I don't know . I failed my exam . __eou__ What did you get ? __eou__ A B plus . __eou__ That's not bad . __eou__ But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! __eou__ Listen , John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ? __eou__ No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know . __eou__ I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ You need to blow off some steam . The world is not on your shoulder . __eou__ How ? __eou__ Forget about school and exams . Come over to my house and have fun . I have some really good DVDs . __eou__ Thanks . But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight . I have to get an early start in the morning . __eou__ Then go to bed and have a good sleep . __eou__ I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend . __eou__ Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams ! __eou__ Thanks , bye . __eou__
You are too picky . __eou__ No , I'm not.Hey , look at that guy over there . __eou__ Which guy ? __eou__ The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window . __eou__ I can't see him . Where ? __eou__ Right there . __eou__ Oh , I see him now . Wait ! That's ... __eou__ Yes , it's Mel Gibson . __eou__ Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ? __eou__ I don't know . Why don't you go ask for his autograph ? __eou__ I can't do that . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time ? __eou__ We have so Ay ! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids . __eou__ That's it ? That's the tradition ? __eou__ Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing . __eou__ I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun . __eou__ You should be there some Christmas Eve . __eou__
Karen , do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something . __eou__ Sure . What is it ? __eou__ I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think . __eou__ I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ? __eou__ I am worried about the meeting this morning . __eou__ Why ? I think the meeting went well . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . But what are you worried about ? __eou__ I'm afraid I was too rude . __eou__ Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ? __eou__ Well , I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry . __eou__ I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that . __eou__ You mean because you are a woman ? __eou__ Yes . And he is the president of the company . __eou__ Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond.He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women . __eou__ I am very happy to hear that , Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company . __eou__ I agree with you on that , Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . I would never change jobs . __eou__ Good . Thank you for telling me this . __eou__ Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.This is a company that appreciates initiative . __eou__
I really admire you , Diana . __eou__ why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . __eou__ you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . __eou__ I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . __eou__ isn't there anything else ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ you must have a high IQ score . __eou__ well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . __eou__ go ahead . __eou__ my IQ score is slightly above average . __eou__ seriously ? But you are such a genius . __eou__ maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__ well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__ you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__ oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__ let's go ! __eou__
Hey Sarah . Why are you limping ? __eou__ Oh . Hi Matt . I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches . __eou__ Was it your first time ? __eou__ Yeah . And I never want to go again . __eou__ I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast . __eou__ That's exactly how I feel now . __eou__ It's only like that the first couple of times . __eou__ Ha . There won't be a next time . __eou__ You gotta give it a chance . It's fun after awhile . __eou__ I'll think about it after I start feeling better . Right now , I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding . __eou__
Hi Mark . __eou__ Oh , hi Stacy . __eou__ How was your summer vacation ? __eou__ I worked over the summer at a restaurant . Have to make tuition money , right ? What did you do ? __eou__ I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up . __eou__ So are you officially a junior now ? __eou__ Yeah . And I have 5 credits to spare . I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but I took 15 because the price was the same . __eou__ That makes sense . So where is Nicole ? __eou__ She dropped out of school completely . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time . __eou__ Wow . She's so lucky . She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job . __eou__ It sounds good now , but I'm traditional . I want the degree , so I wouldn't have accepted the offer . __eou__ Do you know how much they are paying her ? __eou__ I don't know . But I bet it must have been a good offer , or she wouldn't have accepted it . __eou__
What is up ? __eou__ Look at the dishes ! I have told you three times to put away these dishes . But now ... __eou__ Oh , don ’ t be angry . I just thought you might need them sometime . __eou__ I have told you that I don ’ t need them any more . The thing that really annoys me is that you played dumb with me . __eou__
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes . Twice . __eou__
Hey , look at my new shirt . What do you think about it ? __eou__ Just so-so . Where did you get it ? __eou__ I bought it on a street market . A real bargain ! __eou__ I'd much rather buy expensive but good quality clothing , because it is not only nice but lasts a long time . __eou__
Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ? __eou__ Don't brother me ! __eou__ Hey , chill out , I'm just trying to help . __eou__ Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault . __eou__ So , what's the problem ? __eou__ I drew a blank on the algebra test . __eou__ No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? __eou__ Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . __eou__ That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next semester . __eou__ I'm thinking of dropping out . __eou__ You can't do that , Jenny ! __eou__ I'm dead serious about this , Sally . __eou__ Come on , let's talk about it . __eou__
Lisa , I'm home . __eou__ How was your day ? __eou__ Pretty good . I've made a few friends already . __eou__ Anybody I know ? __eou__ Well , Pam Franklin lives next door to us . By the way , can I go to her house this Saturday ? __eou__ Of course . You didn't have to ask me . __eou__ That's what Pam said . __eou__ Just don't stay out too late . __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah . The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time . The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty . We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
Thank you for coming to see me off . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ If have time , I'll come again . __eou__ You're welcome at any time . __eou__ Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay . __eou__ You're most welcome . __eou__ I'm afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon . __eou__ Call us as soon as you get home . __eou__
May I invite you to dance with me ? __eou__ Sorry , I can't dance . __eou__ Never mind , I can teach you . __eou__ Is it difficult to learn ? __eou__ No , it is easy . __eou__ How should I do ? __eou__ You just follow me . __eou__ All right . By the way , do you often dance ? __eou__ Yup , because dance can relax myself . __eou__ It seems a good way . __eou__
Hmm , what should I wear today ? __eou__ Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe . __eou__ Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ? __eou__ I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you . __eou__ Loving to look beautiful is women's nature . In fact , I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today . __eou__ No kidding ! Again ? ! You just went shopping yesterday . You really are a shopaholic . __eou__ Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size . __eou__ OK . Do you have the receipt with you ? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first . __eou__
I'm feeling hungry . __eou__ Isn't it time for dinner ? __eou__ Yes , let's get something to eat . __eou__ How about Mac Donald's ? __eou__
What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? __eou__ I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . __eou__ Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . __eou__ What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . __eou__ We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . __eou__ That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__ I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . __eou__ That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . __eou__ Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . __eou__ Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . __eou__ Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . __eou__
I'll be seeing you around . __eou__ OK.Take care . __eou__
Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look ! __eou__ What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line . __eou__ No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me ! __eou__ You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want . __eou__
Do you object to drinking black tea , Mr.Zhang ? __eou__ Yes , that is why I never drink it . __eou__ Do you drink green tea , then ? __eou__ Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health . __eou__ But if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good . __eou__ What good is it for ? __eou__ Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . __eou__ That's true , but it must not be allowed to stand long . __eou__ Why is it so ? __eou__ Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before , it will do you harm . __eou__
I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool . __eou__ You flatter me . __eou__
Jennifer , would you like to have dinner with me ? __eou__ Yes . That would be nice . When do you want to go ? __eou__ Is today OK ? __eou__ Sorry , I can't go today . __eou__ How about tomorrow night ? __eou__ Ok . What time ? __eou__ Is 9:00 PM all right ? __eou__ I think that's too late . __eou__ Is 6:00 PM OK ? __eou__ Yes , that's good . Where would you like to go ? __eou__ The Italian restaurant on 5th street . __eou__ Oh , I don't like that Restaurant . I don't want to go there . __eou__ How about the Korean restaurant next to it ? __eou__ OK , I like that place . __eou__
Hi , long time no see . How have you been ? __eou__ Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son . __eou__ Tell me all about it . __eou__ Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd . __eou__ Oh , I see . What makes you think that ? __eou__ Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . __eou__ I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ? __eou__ I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through . __eou__ You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life . __eou__ You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . __eou__ I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime . __eou__
Hello , Tom ! Do you have plans for this evening ? __eou__ Nothing special . __eou__ How about having dinner with me ? __eou__ That's great . I would love to .

Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? __eou__ Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? __eou__ Ok that sounds good .

I'd like to meet you again sometime . __eou__ That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime . __eou__ Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 . __eou__ Ok , got it . I will call you sometime next week . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ It's time to go . Bye , Ella . Hope to see you soon __eou__ Bye , Jason . __eou__
Lisa , I'm so glad to see you . How are you doing ? __eou__ Fine . I miss you so much , uncle Benjamin . __eou__ Me too . We haven't seen each other for years . __eou__ It's been 3 years now . __eou__ How time flies ! Now you are a college student out of a little girl . __eou__ How is aunty Shirley ? __eou__ Couldn't be better . __eou__ How has May been ? __eou__ She's been good . She is in grade one in Joy Chain high school . And she dreams to be a volunteer in 2008 . __eou__
When she told me that she would marry no man but Dick , my heart was almost in my mouth . __eou__ You were scared , too ? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that . I almost got fainted . __eou__ I could not and can ’ t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick . He plays the field with many girls . __eou__ But Sarah says she does not care , so long as he loves her . __eou__
Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? __eou__ What ’ s it for ? __eou__ It ’ s for a book . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate your help . __eou__
Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on . __eou__ Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said . __eou__ Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . __eou__ I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . __eou__ No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? __eou__ I got it on sale down at the department store . __eou__ When did you go there ? __eou__ I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . __eou__ I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? __eou__ Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . __eou__ I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . __eou__ That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . __eou__ Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . __eou__ Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? __eou__ Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? __eou__ I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . __eou__ Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans . __eou__ I guess that you will really be dressing down . __eou__ That's my style when I'm not in the office . __eou__ Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles . __eou__

I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon . __eou__ It's a good idea . But please be careful when you invest this time . __eou__ Yes , I will . I should learn more from you .

Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ? __eou__ You can buy some of these nice butterflies . __eou__ No , I'm sorry . I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.It is kind of disgusting . __eou__ What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ? __eou__ Yes . I think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . It is a kind of destruction of nature . __eou__ Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population . __eou__ Who knows ? Hey , I like these jade bears here . __eou__ How much are they ? __eou__ This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ? __eou__ If you want . Didn't you buy her a small vase already ? __eou__ Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this . __eou__ Alright . Buy it then . I won't buy anything . Well , maybe I'll buy some Cognac . __eou__ Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother . He always drinks it . __eou__ Let's go ask about it . __eou__
What's new ? __eou__ Nothing much . __eou__
Hi , Monica , I got big news . __eou__ You got a raise ? __eou__ Not really , just take a wild guess . __eou__ You got promoted ? __eou__ Well , it is not going to happen so soon , I guess . __eou__ You won a lottery ?

I'm frustrated . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ I can't work out this problem . __eou__ Let me take a look . Maybe I can figure it out . __eou__ Thanks . I really appreciate it . __eou__
You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol . __eou__ How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ? __eou__ Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part . __eou__ I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him . __eou__ Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday . __eou__ Are you a member of his fan club ? __eou__ I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now . __eou__ Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? __eou__ Of course !

The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . __eou__ Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? __eou__ I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . __eou__ I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? __eou__ I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I like painters who use will rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? __eou__ I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . __eou__ That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? __eou__ I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . __eou__ I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . __eou__
Jenny , are you having fun here ? __eou__ Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . __eou__ I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . __eou__ Thank you for the invitation . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure .

Hey , Tom , I want to learn how to play golf . __eou__ You're really sporty ! __eou__ I want to do everything I can . __eou__ Do you have clubs ? __eou__ No . Can I rent clubs ? __eou__ There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times . __eou__ What kinds of clubs ? __eou__ Like the seven-piece set . It's only $ 120 . __eou__ I'll buy a set . But you have to teach me . __eou__ Okay . __eou__
You are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? So what's it like ? __eou__ Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart . __eou__ Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . __eou__
What do you mean his grandmothers are already dead ? Wait a minute , you don't think he's avoiding me , do you ? __eou__ Well you know , claiming that your grandmother is sick is the classic excuse used to get out of doing something . __eou__ Oh man , I hate rejection . It really makes you feel terrible , especially when you really liked the person . __eou__ Is there anything I can do to help ? Just remember that I'm there for you if you want to talk about it . __eou__
How do you do , Mr.Smith ? This is Lili . I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday . I enjoyed it very much . __eou__ You're welcome .

I am pleased to help you . __eou__ If there's anything that I can help you in the future , please let me know . __eou__ I'll do that.Thank you.Have a safe trip home . __eou__

I find it very informative.It always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too . __eou__ Is there a Sunday edition of that newspaper ? __eou__ Yes . There is . it has several sections , so it ’ s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning . __eou__ What section does it have ? __eou__ Let me see .

They look at the most important stories in more detail . I find it fascinating . Do you buy a daily paper ? __eou__ I buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper . I find the local news more interesting than national or international news . __eou__
You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . __eou__ Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . __eou__ I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . __eou__ Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__ Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__ Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . __eou__
Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . __eou__ I've said you will enjoy your life here ! __eou__ I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time . __eou__ My children would like that ; they like dancing very much . __eou__ That's good ! __eou__ Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ? __eou__ Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself . __eou__ He performs very well . He is so funny ! __eou__ OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family ! __eou__ OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour . __eou__ OK , got it ! Thank you so much . You have helped me a lot ! __eou__ You are welcome ! We are neighbors ! __eou__
You look pale , you must have poor health . __eou__ Yeah . You said it . __eou__ Why not go to see the doctor ? __eou__ I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . __eou__
How is Tom now ? __eou__ He's out of the hospital and up and about again at last . __eou__ Let's congratulate him on Sunday . __eou__
You said you like classical music very much . Then who is your favorite opera star ? __eou__ There are three of them , the Three Tenors . __eou__ Oh , you mean Pavarotti , Domingo and Carreras . Have you been to their live shows ? __eou__ Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing . __eou__ I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song . __eou__ Besides , speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert . __eou__ Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . __eou__ Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? __eou__ Yes , I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 . __eou__ Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . __eou__ That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever . __eou__ Who was the conductor at that event ? __eou__ Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday . __eou__ So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future . __eou__ The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know , music is transnational . __eou__ I believe in that . Well , the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet . __eou__
I really need to find a parking spot . __eou__ Are you looking for a space on or off campus ? __eou__ Do you know any spaces on campus ? __eou__ You can park in the student parking structure . __eou__ Where is it located ? __eou__ You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus . __eou__ Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left ? __eou__ Last time I checked , it was pretty empty . __eou__ What time was it when you went up there ? __eou__ That was earlier this morning . __eou__ It wouldn't be full right now , would it ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__
Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ? __eou__ We need to talk about the size of the country and its population . __eou__ Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population . __eou__ It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population . __eou__ We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ? __eou__ We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year . __eou__ That sounds very general . __eou__ It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one . __eou__ One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ? __eou__ Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou . __eou__ We should take a large map and highlight those cities . What is each of them famous for ? __eou__
I learned of the railway accident only this morning . __eou__ A really dreadful accident and many people were killed . __eou__ Is that true ? __eou__ Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Who is responsible for the accident ? Is it Tony ’ s fault ? __eou__ No . I don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . The man in the other car made a big mistake . __eou__ You mean Tony is the victim ? No , I don ’ t think so . He ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . __eou__ Yeah . I think everyone should go easy on driving . __eou__
Did you hear who won the English speech contest ? __eou__ No , who won ? __eou__ It's George . __eou__ Really ? I'm surprised . I didn't know his English was that good . __eou__
He's honest , hardworking and responsible . I simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee . __eou__ I rather doubt it.You ' re cheated by his appearance , I think . __eou__ Don't be so jealous . He never speaks ill of you before me . __eou__
Paul , let's go and see Grandpa this afternoon . __eou__ But Grandpa will be working . __eou__ It's Saturday . __eou__ I almost forget . __eou__

I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__ Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . __eou__ Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . __eou__ I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . __eou__ Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! __eou__
our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . __eou__ really ? Where did you hear that ? __eou__ I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? __eou__ I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . __eou__ no , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__ that's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . __eou__ Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . __eou__ well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . __eou__ no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t __eou__ well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost b __eou__
Do you often surf the Internet ? __eou__ Yeah . I do it once a week . __eou__ Is it very interesting ? __eou__ Sure . I get a lot of information and make many friends . __eou__ Oh , I'll have a try . __eou__
I want to say ... __eou__ Say it ! What is it ? __eou__ That I can't go on any longer without you . __eou__ You know you shouldn't say that at a time like this . __eou__ Nancy , I made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight . __eou__ Too sudden ! I'm not ready for it . __eou__ Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments . __eou__ Stop it . No more of that talk . __eou__ I really love you . __eou__ No , I shall faint . __eou__ And I hope so . This is what you were meant for . Say you love me , say yes , say yes . __eou__ Yes . __eou__

Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? __eou__ You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ? __eou__ Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning.So , let ’ s have a try . My treat . __eou__ Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . __eou__ Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . __eou__ Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . __eou__ For sure all the customers will benefit from this . __eou__
You were right . It's raining again . __eou__ I told you so . __eou__

Are you best friends , too ? __eou__ We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn ’ t mention to your biological father . __eou__ I don ’ t know much about him . He died when I was just a baby .

Does he keep in touch with her ? __eou__ No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later . __eou__ Sounds like it was meant to be . __eou__
It's awfully quiet around here . __eou__ Yeah . There's nobody in sight . __eou__ I have a feeling that we're not supposed to be in here . __eou__ I think you're right . Let's go . __eou__

Table tennis is probably the most popular . __eou__ I expect all Chinese can play table tennis . __eou__ Most anyway . __eou__ Do you like playing table tennis ? __eou__ Yes , I like . But I can't play it well . __eou__ Are indoor sports popular ? __eou__ Basketball and swimming are very popular . __eou__ Really ? I like playing basketball , too . __eou__ We can play together if you are free . __eou__ That's great . __eou__

They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . __eou__ The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . __eou__ That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . There are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them . __eou__ There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . __eou__ We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . __eou__

Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? __eou__ Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? __eou__ Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? __eou__ You ’ Ve put it among these journals . __eou__ My poor memory . Thank you very much . __eou__

Are you stressed at all ? __eou__ well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . __eou__ you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . __eou__ you're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? __eou__ taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . __eou__ I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! __eou__ you need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . __eou__ you ’ re right . I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . __eou__ besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . __eou__ that ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! __eou__ good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! __eou__
Before we begin eating , I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's a Taiwanese puppet doll . __eou__ It's huge ! __eou__ Yeah . They're usually this big . __eou__ The craftsmanship is excellent . __eou__ All the parts work . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Can I still get tickets for tonight's performance ? __eou__ The balcony is still available . __eou__ Aren't there any other seats ? __eou__ No , I'm afraid that's it . __eou__
It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why don't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together ? __eou__ I have found myself a date mate . __eou__ You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun . __eou__ A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait . __eou__
Would you like some coffee , Tom ? __eou__ Yes , thank you . __eou__ Here's some sugar . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong . __eou__ OK , OK , this is good . Keep talking . What about cappuccino and all those other drinks ? __eou__ Cappuccino is one-third espresso and two-thirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth . __eou__ Froth ? __eou__ If you want something manly , stick with the espresso . __eou__ Thanks , Hugh . I owe you one . __eou__
What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? __eou__ Don't believe him.He ' s a liar . __eou__ We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . __eou__
Another weekend is coming ! __eou__ And we're going to have summer vacation . __eou__ Yes.What will you do this weekend ? __eou__ I'll plan for the vacation . __eou__
Hello , Tom . How do you find the dinner of yesterday ? __eou__ Very good . That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten . __eou__ It's nice of you to say so . __eou__ I really appreciate you for having invited me . __eou__ Don't mention it . You know , we ’ re old friends . __eou__ Anyway , I owe you one . Are you free tonight ? __eou__ Yes . Why ? __eou__ I want to invite you to enjoy the food I cook . __eou__ That ’ s great . I'd love to . __eou__
Thank you for your letter . __eou__ Is your waist any better ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m feeling very well these days . __eou__ I ’ m glad you are getting better . __eou__ And I was glad to receive your letter . __eou__ Then when will you be back again ? __eou__ I will be back again next Wednesday . __eou__ I hope to see you at that time again . Bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
When I was a little boy , I had a dream of becoming a lawyer . __eou__ Your dream comes true now . __eou__ Yes , I knew I would make it . __eou__ You are really confident . __eou__
This is my uncle , Charles . __eou__ He looks strong.What does he do ? __eou__ He's a captain . __eou__ He must be very brave . __eou__ Exactly ! __eou__
How's your brother doing ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , he hasn't been feeling too well . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . What's the matter ? __eou__ Tell him I hope he's better soon . __eou__ I'll tell him . Thanks for asking about him . __eou__
Are you a soccer fan ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I like to watch soccer games on TV , but I don ’ t play . I watched every game of the 2002 World Cup . __eou__ Which team is your favorite ? __eou__ Italian . They played very well , but they were not very lucky . __eou__ I like the Brazilians . They are the real champions . __eou__
What are you doing , awake ? __eou__ I can't sleep ... __eou__ But it's almost midnight ! __eou__ Exactly . I'm too excited for Christmas morning . Also , I thought I heard Santa . __eou__ Really ? How do you know it was Santa ? __eou__ Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs ! __eou__ Hmm ... well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree , spying on him ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Really ! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . That way , we can let Santa do his job . Then when you wake up , it will be Christmas already ! __eou__ O-K ... __eou__ Hey , honey ! Is that you ? Don't eat all the cookies — I want some , too ! __eou__
Hey Eve , how are you ? __eou__ I ’ m fine , Celia . And you ? __eou__ I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy ! __eou__ Do you have a lot of homework ? __eou__ Yes . Don ’ t you ? __eou__ Of course I do ! __eou__ Which class are you working on right now ? __eou__ I ’ m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow . __eou__ Are you in Mrs Green ’ s class ? __eou__ Yes . Are you ? __eou__ Yes . We must have the same exam tomorrow ! __eou__ Do you want to study together ? __eou__ Sure . This library is too quiet though . __eou__ Do you want to go to and empty classroom ? __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ Ok . Let ’ s go ! __eou__
Are you ready to go the concert ? __eou__ Yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? __eou__ Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour . __eou__ That's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . __eou__ Is your helmet comfortable ? __eou__ Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . __eou__ Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . __eou__ I'll think about it . __eou__ Is that your new bicycle ? __eou__ Yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? __eou__ It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! __eou__ Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky . __eou__ I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? __eou__ Well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? __eou__ That's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . __eou__ Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? __eou__ It's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . __eou__
Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . __eou__ But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? __eou__ That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . __eou__ Thank you for your hospitality . __eou__ Thanks for coming . __eou__ How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . __eou__ Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then . __eou__ Well . I really do have to go . __eou__ Good night then . __eou__ See you tomorrow . __eou__
I'm going for a walk , Yi-jun . I need some time to myself . __eou__ Don't you want to go to the visiting hours ? This sheet says they are tonight . __eou__ I just can't right now . Everyone will be talking about Taylor and ... __eou__ ... and maybe that's what we both need . __eou__ I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow . __eou__ OK , but don't forget I'm here for you , and I know how you feel . It's my loss , too . __eou__
You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . __eou__ What makes you say that ? __eou__ I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first . __eou__ But everything has been so easy . __eou__ Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that . __eou__ Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things . __eou__ Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you . __eou__
Write down your name here in ink . __eou__ But I don ’ t have a pen with me . May I use a pencil ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid a pencil won ’ t do . Wait a moment , I ’ ll find you one . __eou__
this party rocks ! __eou__ you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! __eou__ I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love ! __eou__ well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ? __eou__ oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? __eou__ yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me ! __eou__ I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice . __eou__ I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league . __eou__ come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try . __eou__ okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game . __eou__ all right . But I think you ought to move soon . __eou__ why ? __eou__ I can see five other guys eying her up . __eou__ okay , here I go ! __eou__ good luck ! __eou__
Do you watch a lot of TV ? __eou__ Not really . I could take it or leave it . __eou__ Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on . __eou__ How can you do that ? __eou__
I am certain I am going to fail my English test . __eou__ Why are you so pessimistic ? __eou__ Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week . __eou__ Only for this reason ? __eou__ Yes , I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad . __eou__ Don't worry about it . Practice makes perfect . I will lend you some listening materials , so that you can practise more before the exam . I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . __eou__ Oh , thank you . That's very nice of you . __eou__
Hello ! So you are leaving today . __eou__ Hello . Thank you for seeing me off . You actually don't need to bother . __eou__ It is my pleasure to see you off . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I hope to see you again . __eou__ I hope so , too . __eou__ Thanks again for everything you have done for me . __eou__ You're welcome . Have a nice trip ! __eou__
Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . __eou__ He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . __eou__ Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . __eou__ It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . __eou__
I go to the fitness center every weekend . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ To lose some weight . __eou__ Why , you look pretty all right . __eou__
Uh-oh . I'm in trouble . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong ? __eou__ I just remembered that I've got to give a speech in class today and I forgot to prepare for it . __eou__ I guess you'll have to wing it . __eou__
I heard you received a prize for you book . __eou__ yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . __eou__ congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement . __eou__ actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus . __eou__ what was the prize ? __eou__ I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice . __eou__ that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! Have you ever won a prize before ? __eou__ I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz . __eou__ I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! __eou__
To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . __eou__ To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had . __eou__ How could you manage to pass the exam ? __eou__ It is still a mystery to me . __eou__
What date is it today ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Look at the girls in the street . They all have a bunch of flowers.Is it Valentine's Day ? __eou__ Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . __eou__ Did you have a fight with Jack ? __eou__ No , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? __eou__ Come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . __eou__ You know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . __eou__ Is that your phone ? __eou__ Oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . __eou__ Wow ! Good timing . __eou__ He asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? __eou__ Come on ! Three's a crowd ! __eou__ So what ? __eou__ Just go ! It's Valentine's Day ! __eou__
I heard that your previous manager was very capable , he is a good manger . __eou__ That ’ s a matter of opinion . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I worked with him for two years . That was the worst time in my career . __eou__
And lots of " Dear Abby " sob stories ... __eou__ Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! __eou__ No wonder you're such a wacko ... __eou__ Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples ! __eou__ Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... __eou__ You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ? __eou__
How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? __eou__ We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . __eou__ Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . __eou__ But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she Isa backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . __eou__
I find that every employee here respects that manager very much . __eou__ Yes . He carries a lot of weight . Everyone here is willing to follow his orders . __eou__
What's your favorite book ? __eou__ It's Gone With the Wind . __eou__ Why do you like it best ? __eou__ I enjoy the various characters and the plot . __eou__ Well . I like the Thom Birds best . __eou__ Is it very interesting ? __eou__ Sure . I like the writer's language , too . __eou__ If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . __eou__ Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? __eou__ That's a good idea.Let ' s go ! __eou__
It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . __eou__ The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! __eou__ Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! __eou__ It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . __eou__ Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break . __eou__
Hello , Grace . That's a beautiful skirt you have on . Where are you going ? __eou__ I am going to attend an interview . __eou__ What kind of job are you applying for ? __eou__ My major is English . Of course I'll apply for an English teacher . __eou__ Oh . That dress doesn't exactly match the job . __eou__ Why ? You said my skirt was beautiful just now . __eou__ Yes , your skirt is really beautiful , but you are applying for a teaching position . You see , your skirt is very short , and your make up is too thick . What's more , the color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin . As a teacher , you should be a little more sedate . __eou__ Then what should I do ? __eou__ Some of my friends tell me that being a teacher , the most important is the beauty of mind . You shouldn't pay too much attention to your appearance . You should appear frugal and prudent . Your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer . __eou__
I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . __eou__ He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . __eou__ If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . __eou__
London is such a historical city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . __eou__ Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . __eou__ Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ’ s . __eou__ She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? __eou__ There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too . __eou__ I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go . __eou__ Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum . __eou__ There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . __eou__ Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum ! __eou__
so , how should we go to the theatre ? __eou__ let's take the bus . __eou__ I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . __eou__ it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . __eou__ it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . __eou__ we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . __eou__ train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . __eou__ if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? __eou__ we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . __eou__ I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . __eou__ fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . __eou__ it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . __eou__ don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . __eou__ thanks , that was nice of you . __eou__ see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! __eou__
Mary , please go to the door . I hear the bell . __eou__ It's the mailman , Mother . Here's a letter from Uncle George . __eou__ Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . __eou__ When's he coming ? __eou__ He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth . He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth . __eou__ Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? __eou__ No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls . __eou__ Mother , I don't remember the girls . How old are they ? __eou__ Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen . __eou__ Are they going to stay here with us ? __eou__ Of course . The girls can stay in your room with you . __eou__ Mother , may we have a party ? __eou__ If you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things . __eou__ Prepare the list , Mother . I can go shopping . I can go to the small stores.Everyone knows me there . __eou__
What's your little caper ? Come home so late ! We are all worried about you . __eou__ Oh , I am terribly sorry . But I was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit . So I forgot the time . __eou__ Singing ? At the subway exit ? Oh , it sounds like someone needs some money . __eou__ Oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . He sang for appreciation , but not for money . __eou__ It is just pop song , you could have sung there too if you want it . __eou__ Oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . I like it but I couldn't do it that well . __eou__ Honey , just do it next time . Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia ? __eou__ No , but tell me some . I am interested . __eou__ Many oil painting exhibitions are there . That is a kind of Museum Exhibition . __eou__ Are there many people there ? Do you think people actually like them ? __eou__ I am sure you will . There are some works , and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train . __eou__ But I still prefer the pop music in the subway . __eou__ Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts , but with different aesthetic values . __eou__ Dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ? __eou__ Not well enough , but I'm learning . __eou__
It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week . __eou__ Indeed . I love the smell of the grass and trees . They certainly refresh my mind . __eou__ Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy . __eou__ Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky . __eou__ Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture . __eou__ Yes . Will it hurt us ? __eou__ I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . __eou__ OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem . __eou__ I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know . __eou__ You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree . __eou__ Well , it is a birch tree.It is not as old as you think . __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree . __eou__
Can we talk ? __eou__ Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ You know what I mean . __eou__ Yeah . I know . __eou__ I want to know where this relationship is going . I ’ m in love with you and I need to know ... __eou__ You know , I think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . __eou__ Honey ... __eou__ Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... __eou__ Baby , I love you so much . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ Oh , I love you too ! __eou__ Come on . Put the gun down . __eou__ Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . __eou__
Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ? __eou__ Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat . __eou__ When did you decide to become a vegetarian ? __eou__ I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since . __eou__ That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ? __eou__ Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them . __eou__ You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ? __eou__ I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great ! __eou__ How do you get enough protein in your diet ? __eou__ Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish . __eou__ Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ? __eou__ I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it . __eou__ How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ? __eou__ That sounds great . What time should I come over ? __eou__ Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm , so you can come over at 7 p . m . __eou__ Sounds good . See you there ! __eou__
How old is Keith ? __eou__ He ’ s 21 . how old is James ? __eou__ He ’ s a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . __eou__ How ’ s your father ? __eou__ He ’ s fine . He retired last week . It ’ s turning going in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . __eou__ He can spend more time with his grandchildren . __eou__ Oh , I don ’ t think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . __eou__ So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! __eou__ How do you want to spend your old age ? __eou__ In the same way , probably . __eou__
Is this seat taken ? __eou__ No . Please sit down . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Are you also going to Beijing ? __eou__ Yes , on a business trip . How about Yuu ? __eou__ I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? __eou__ Yes , I Went there once last summer . __eou__ Really ? What did you think ? __eou__ I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . __eou__ Was it that crowded ? __eou__ Yes.These were always so many people.After taking the subway during the rush hour , you'll envy sardines in their cans . __eou__ Oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . __eou__ That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! __eou__ Thank you very much ! __eou__
I love ice cream . __eou__ Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? __eou__ I like both strawberry and coffee ice cream . __eou__ Chocolate is mine . __eou__
Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . __eou__ Well , Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . __eou__ I will think about it . __eou__ Come on ! It is really a fun game . __eou__
Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? __eou__ Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? __eou__ Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . __eou__ That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . __eou__ Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? __eou__ When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . __eou__ I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? __eou__ Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . __eou__ Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . __eou__ Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . __eou__ You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . __eou__ Sure . What about you ? What do you like about the Olympics ? __eou__ For me , the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible . __eou__ Hey , young man , you are so deep today . __eou__ I always am . You just didn't notice . __eou__
It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . __eou__ So the reform cannot be carried out well . __eou__ Government is making efforts to change situation . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__
Does she make any sense to you ? __eou__ No . It's all Greek to me . __eou__ She's speaking French , not Greek . __eou__ I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all . __eou__ Me neither . All I have to do is study French hard . __eou__ I wish you the best of luck . __eou__
How are you going all these days ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . __eou__ But you look depressed . __eou__ I have some problem with my work . __eou__ Is it serious ? __eou__ I can solve it , thanks . __eou__ How about your family ? __eou__ Everything is Okay . And as soon as I see my son at home , all my worries vanish into the blue . __eou__
So what do you feel like doing this evening ? How about going to the cinema ? __eou__ Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema . __eou__ That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't . __eou__ Why ? Do you have to prepare for your examination ? Oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important . __eou__ That's not the reason . I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening . You know , I've been going there every week . __eou__ Oh , God , I've forgotten it . __eou__ You said you wanted to improve your English , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? I can also introduce some friends to you . __eou__ Oh , no , I don't want to know any more geeks like you . __eou__ They are not geeks . They are also interested in singing , dancing , and so on . They are excellent , and they can always help me a lot . __eou__ Really ? Is there a foreign teacher for every class ? __eou__ It depends . If they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us . __eou__ So you just talk all the time ? __eou__ Of course not . The foreign teachers also teach us English songs , and play games with us . __eou__ That sounds interesting . I'll go with you tomorrow evening . __eou__ You won't be disappointed . __eou__
You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . __eou__ If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . __eou__ I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . __eou__ I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . __eou__ Thank you . I wish I would . __eou__ Good luck to you . __eou__
Wow , is that your sports car ? __eou__ Yes , do you like it ? __eou__ I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? __eou__ Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ Well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . __eou__ When's the last time you had it serviced ? __eou__ It must have been a few years ago now . __eou__ I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . __eou__ They do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! __eou__ What else is wrong with it ? __eou__ The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ The brakes don't really work that well anymore either . __eou__ Why don't you get it all fixed ? __eou__ It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! __eou__ Well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! __eou__
Can you play baseball with me today ? __eou__ No , I can't . I'm sorry . I have to help my mother . We're going to move tomorrow . __eou__ Where's the new house ? Is it far from here ? __eou__ No , it's not far . It's near our old house . __eou__ Can I help you pack ? __eou__ Sure . Thanks . __eou__
I think I need a new notebook . __eou__ Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? __eou__ You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! __eou__ That's a notebook ? __eou__ Believe it ! __eou__ It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! __eou__
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? __eou__ I suppose I do . __eou__ The climate here is pleasant . __eou__ You said it . __eou__ This city is really comfortable to live in . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ No other city can match it . It's heaven . __eou__ Well , if you live in other cities as long as enough , you will love them just as much . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__ That's for sure . __eou__
Ah , Michelle , hi . I was hoping to see you . How have you been ? How's the family ? __eou__ Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ? __eou__ I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ? __eou__ Yes , I'm leaving at four pm . __eou__ Good , well we can discuss this more then , but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter . __eou__ Yes , me too . __eou__ I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising . __eou__
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market . __eou__ Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you . __eou__ Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ? __eou__ You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive ! __eou__ Well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! __eou__ Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ? __eou__
Hi Bob , this is my friend Mary . __eou__ I am very pleased to meet you . __eou__ Bob is in advertising . __eou__ That sounds an interesting job , Bob . __eou__
Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here ! __eou__ What are you so excited about ? __eou__ I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! __eou__ What ’ s the big deal ? It ’ s just a picture of some woman . __eou__ I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person . __eou__ There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . __eou__ Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? __eou__ No , how much is it worth ? __eou__ About 80 million dollars . __eou__ Whoa . __eou__
Lady , you look unhappy . What ’ s the beef ? __eou__ A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi . __eou__
When were you Bron may I ask ? __eou__ On 20th May 1963 . __eou__ Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? __eou__ 27th day of the fourth month . __eou__ By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? __eou__ It will begin at 5 thirty . __eou__ I am frigid I can't be there on time . __eou__ You can see it tomorrow . __eou__ I don't want to miss it today . __eou__ See you . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night . __eou__ Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' . __eou__ He seems to win awards everywhere . __eou__ He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World . __eou__ I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . ' __eou__ That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia . __eou__
Ben cancelled his trip . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ Because General , his dog , got sick . __eou__ He's such a mother hen . __eou__
Hi Jane , you look great . __eou__ You too . Have you lost some weight ? __eou__ Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . __eou__ Not some crazy diet fat I hope . __eou__ No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . __eou__ Good for you , keep it up . __eou__
It may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing . __eou__ How did they hear ? No one called . __eou__ In times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . But his whole family was here . __eou__ His mom and dad must be destroyed . He was their only son . __eou__ And he was so young , with so much life to look forward to . __eou__ Yes ... thank you for understanding . We have to go now . __eou__ This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location . __eou__
OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see ! __eou__ Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London . __eou__ OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . __eou__ Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ? __eou__ Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . __eou__ Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? __eou__ Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! __eou__ Is that how you feel on the bus ? __eou__ Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time . __eou__ So , so you're British , do you missing them ? __eou__ Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes . __eou__
Is the view going to be ok ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . __eou__ I ’ ll do my best . __eou__ That ’ s the way to go . __eou__
I got a promotion . Lunch is on me . __eou__ It ’ s great . __eou__
You can keep these books for only half a month . __eou__ May I renew them if I haven't finished reading them ? __eou__ Of course , you can . __eou__
Bob , you look pale . What happened ? __eou__ I didn't sleep a wink last night . __eou__ Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned ! Maybe I can help you . __eou__ Well , I'm under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near and I still haven't finish one of them . __eou__ Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress . __eou__ I know your feeling . Take it easy . __eou__
Which team won ? __eou__ The Spur . __eou__ What was the score ? __eou__ They managed a 99:80 victory . __eou__
You know ... I did very poorly on that test . __eou__ Cheer up ! It's not the only chance in life to do well on a test . There'll be many more . __eou__ Well , you know how I am about exams . I'm a perfectionist . __eou__ Don't worry about it . All in all , you've done very well in school . __eou__
What happened to Nancy ? She is all sweetness and light today . __eou__ She is going to get married . __eou__ No wonder ! Who is the bridegroom ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . __eou__
I think Bill Clinton is a good president . __eou__ But he has the sex scandal . __eou__ Well . Maybe he isn't a good husband , but he is a successful president . __eou__ I agree . He is also an excellent speaker . __eou__ Yes , he is . Of course he makes mistakes , but who doesn ’ t . __eou__ yeah , it ’ s fair to say so . __eou__
What good sunshine ! Let's go and get a suntan on the balcony . __eou__ I've had enough of it while working under the sun in the day . I don't need any more sun-tan . __eou__ It's different in my case . I work in the office , so only rarely do I get the chance to get any sun . __eou__ It might be good to you . But please keep in mind that too much tanning damages the skin rather than does any good to you . You might end up with skin cancer . __eou__
Would you like to stretch your legs ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Let's get a soft drink . __eou__ Do we have enough time ? __eou__ Yes , we do . __eou__ The performance is excellent . __eou__ It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__ Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Do you have concert halls in your city ? __eou__ Yes , but it's much smaller . __eou__ Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Wake up sleepyhead.The sun is beginning to shine . What a lovely summer day ! __eou__ Yeah , clearly blue sky.But it is a bit too hot for me . I don't like heat and humidity . __eou__ It's not that hot . It's cooler than yesterday . Let's go swimming ! __eou__ That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned . __eou__ Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini . __eou__ There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are . __eou__ Who cares ! Well , the smart guys get there early . That's the kind of guy I want to meet . Let's go ! __eou__ If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini , then I want to wear one , too . __eou__ Ok , you could borrow one of mine . __eou__ Thanks , how about the green and black one ? __eou__ No problem . Here it is . __eou__
It's a beautiful day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , isn't it . __eou__ Do you now the temperature today ? __eou__ It's beautiful 75 degrees . __eou__ How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . __eou__ Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . __eou__ What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home . __eou__ I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans . __eou__ That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . __eou__
are you ready to go the concert ? __eou__ yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? __eou__ actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour . __eou__ that's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . __eou__ is your helmet comfortable ? __eou__ not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . __eou__ maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . __eou__ I'll think about it . __eou__ is that your new bicycle ? __eou__ yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? __eou__ it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! __eou__ nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky . __eou__ I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? __eou__ well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? __eou__ that's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . __eou__ is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? __eou__ it's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . __eou__
Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? __eou__ Yes , here you go . __eou__ Will you be checking any bags today . __eou__ Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . __eou__ What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ s absurd ! __eou__ I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . __eou__ Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . __eou__ Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . __eou__ That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! __eou__
Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ? __eou__ I'd like that very much . __eou__ How does 7:30 sound ? __eou__ Fine . See you later . __eou__
How are you ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ I haven ’ t seen you for several days . __eou__ Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week . __eou__ What ’ s he doing ? __eou__ He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week . __eou__ He must be happy . __eou__ Yeah . How are you these days ? __eou__ Fine too . __eou__
So what kind of music turns you on ? __eou__ Rock ' n'Roll , I guess . __eou__ You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? __eou__ Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . __eou__
Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . __eou__ But yesterday you said you would rent it . __eou__ I ’ Ve changed my mind . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . __eou__ Maybe you ’ re right . __eou__
Hi ! How are you going ? __eou__ Fine , thank you.How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ Not bad.How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time . __eou__ Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday . __eou__ Did you enjoy yourself ? __eou__ Very much.New York is such a nice place.Shall I show you some photographs ? __eou__ Thanks , I like looking at photographs.How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day . __eou__ You too . I hope to see you soon.Goodbye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
You ready ? __eou__ Am I ready for what ? __eou__ Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ? __eou__ Oh . Yes , I ’ m ready to transfer . __eou__ You ’ re not nervous , are you ? __eou__ I ’ m very nervous . __eou__ Why are you nervous ? __eou__ I ’ m not going to know anybody there . __eou__ That ’ s not a problem . __eou__ That makes me nervous . __eou__ It ’ s fun meeting new people . __eou__ I didn ’ t think about it that way . __eou__
Did you see Victor on Wednesday , Wendy ? __eou__ Yes . We went for a walk in the woods near the highway . __eou__ Wasn ’ t it cold on Wednesday ? __eou__ Yes . It was very cold and windy . We wore heavy wool sweaters and walked quickly to keep warm . __eou__ It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods . __eou__ Yes . Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . We counted over twenty squirrels . __eou__ It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? __eou__ Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway . __eou__
Wow ! That ’ s a pretty dress , but it ’ s too expensive . __eou__ Yeah , it is ! Why is it so expensive ? __eou__ It ’ s because of good quality and the fine design . __eou__ I don ’ t think it ’ s worth that money . __eou__ Anyhow , this dress is really elegant . __eou__
How is your business going ? __eou__ Business couldn't be better . __eou__ Really ? Maybe I should work for you . __eou__ Welcome . I could use the help . __eou__
Hey , what's the matter ? __eou__ It doesn't matter . I just feel a little dizzy . __eou__ Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__
I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? __eou__ Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . __eou__ I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? __eou__ Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . __eou__ You mean you didn ’ t know much English then ? __eou__ Right . I only knew a few English sentences . __eou__ That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? __eou__ First , I worked as a servant . __eou__ Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . __eou__ I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . __eou__
What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? __eou__ We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . __eou__ What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ? __eou__ From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! __eou__ You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ? __eou__ Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived ! __eou__
What do you know about Julia Roberts ? __eou__ Her acting is OK . __eou__ I mean her personality . __eou__ I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? __eou__
I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help . __eou__ Sure , no problem . What are you trying to get ? __eou__ I want to buy a drink . __eou__ OK . This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change . __eou__ I've got the correct change already . __eou__ First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . The dollars have to be smooth . __eou__ OK , what next ? __eou__ Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again . __eou__ OK , next ? __eou__ Choose what you want and push the button . Sometimes it takes a couple of tries . __eou__ I agree with you . __eou__ Hope that works for you ! __eou__
Honey , wait ! I've sprained my ankle . __eou__ Oh , my god , are you OK ? __eou__ Of course not ! __eou__ Come on , sit down , and let me have a look . __eou__ The pain is killing me . __eou__ I told you to wear running shoes . But you don't listen . __eou__ I thought leather shoes will do just as well . __eou__ Hold on , don't move , I will take care of that . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.How does that feel ? __eou__ God ! It's freezing ! __eou__ Be brave . Don't worry . You will be able to walk soon . __eou__
So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? __eou__ Nine total . Seven children and my parents . __eou__ Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . __eou__ Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . __eou__ Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college . __eou__ They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight . __eou__
That was a nice funeral . __eou__ Yes , dad , it was . __eou__ The son gave a nice speech about his father . __eou__ It was long , too . __eou__ I think it was about 45 minutes long . __eou__ But it went by fast . It was interesting . __eou__ I liked it . __eou__ I'll give you a speech like that , too . __eou__ Do you think anyone will come to my funeral ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ I think only the family will be there . __eou__ You have lots of friends . They will be there , too ! __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi , Randy . What are you doing right now ? __eou__ Nothing . Just watching TV . __eou__ I ’ Ve got two tickets for a newly released film . Would you like to see it with me ? __eou__ Sure . What time ? __eou__ The film will start at 2 __eou__ Sounds good . Where and when will we meet ? __eou__ In my parking lot , at 2pm . __eou__ All right . See you then . __eou__
How do you think TaiWan's economy is doing ? __eou__ Not too good actually , people are not spending as much as before ! __eou__ Do you know why that is ? __eou__ Lots of reasons I guess , unemployment is pretty high these days . __eou__
Does your child still believe in Santa Claus ? __eou__ Yes . She believes everything about him . __eou__ How sweet . __eou__ Yes . If she doesn't believe it , Christmas won't be so exciting to her . __eou__ When are you going to tell her that Santa Claus doesn't exist ? __eou__ I'm not going to tell her . She will find out and understand when she grows older . __eou__
I am kind of nervous . __eou__ Nervous ? Why ? __eou__ I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do . __eou__ Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it . __eou__ Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it . __eou__ Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that . __eou__ Alright . But will we sing ? __eou__ Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can . __eou__ I don't know the words . __eou__ There is a songbook . All the words are in the songbook.Many people have to read the words . __eou__ And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? __eou__ No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist . __eou__ Eu-char-ist ? What is that ? __eou__ That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist . __eou__ It doesn't sound like an English word . __eou__ It's not . It's an ancient Greek word . It means gratitude . __eou__ Alright . Well , I feel more comfortable now.Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor . __eou__ Of course you are . I wouldn't ask you otherwise . __eou__
Hey Jack . How were your classes this semester ? __eou__ They were not too bad . I really liked my poli-sci class . __eou__ Would you consider it your favorite class ? __eou__ I don't know if I would call it my favorite , but it ranks up there . __eou__ What class was your favorite then ? __eou__ I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific . __eou__ I never took that yet . If that was your favorite , I think I will check it out . __eou__
What are you reading ? __eou__ It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . __eou__ It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . __eou__ Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English . __eou__ Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? __eou__ The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . __eou__ Right . All the people who speak Chinese . Hindi , French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages . __eou__ Exactly . The article suggests that those languages will be used , but that they will only rarely be used in international communication between non-native speakers . __eou__ In that case , I shall continue to learning a few basic phrases in other languages . __eou__
Are you have a hand in locking into the case ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How do you feel about it ? __eou__ It is really a hard nut to crack . The problem is that the crime was done without leaving any trace . __eou__
Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise . __eou__ How about taking a walk in the park ? __eou__ OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . __eou__ Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! __eou__ Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left . __eou__ Oh , I see them.Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . __eou__ A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . __eou__
Another glass of beer , will you ? __eou__ Thanks , I'm enough . __eou__ At least one for your trip . __eou__ I'll have it if you insist . __eou__
Have you seen that house ? __eou__ Yes , it looks interesting . __eou__ You're right . I love it very much . __eou__ It must be old . __eou__ At least more than 100 years old . __eou__ Let's enter it ! __eou__ I can't open the door . __eou__ It must be locked . __eou__ Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . __eou__ She can't answer you . __eou__ She must be deaf . __eou__ It must be a haunted house.Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking . __eou__
Good morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking . __eou__ Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker .

It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40 ° C . __eou__ Do you like the weather in Seattle ? __eou__ Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . __eou__ What about the weather in Boston ? __eou__ I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter ? __eou__ Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . __eou__
Wei , you look really tired . __eou__ Yes , I didn ’ t finish work until 9:00 pm . __eou__ 9:00 ! __eou__ Yes , I have too much work to do at the moment . __eou__ Why ’ s that ? __eou__ Because too many people in the office are on holiday . __eou__
I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport . __eou__ Oh , thanks a lot . __eou__ What time are you leaving ? __eou__ 1:30 P . m . But I've got to check in at 12:30 P . m . __eou__ What airline and what flight ? __eou__ Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 . __eou__ I'll see you at the airport at 12:30 P . m . __eou__ Ok .

He was hauled up last week for the second time . __eou__ You mean he had been put in prison before . __eou__ Of course , he is a man with a history . __eou__ Oh , he had fooled me . __eou__
Hello . Can I sit here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ By the way , I'm Robin . __eou__ Hi . My name is Jessica . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ Pleased to meet you too . And where are you from , Robin ? __eou__ I'm from Kathmandu . What about you ? __eou__ I'm from New York . Oh , this is my stop . Bye , Robin . __eou__ Bye . See you . __eou__
Well , I've never downloaded music before . How does it work ? __eou__ You haven't ? If you've never tried it I can show you how . __eou__ Alright . But why is downloading music better than buying Cds at the store ? __eou__ Downloading music is really fast and convenient , and you can preview all the songs before you buy them . __eou__
Hi ! How are you doing ? __eou__ Good , thanks . How about you ? __eou__ Pretty good . Say , where are you living this semester ? __eou__ In No . 4 Dorm . I like dorm life . You will meet a lot of people and you don't have to cook . What about you ? __eou__ Oh , I am looking for an apartment . I prefer living off campus . I can study better . __eou__ I hope you will find a place . Listen , I'd better go . I am going to be late for class . __eou__ Okay , see you around . __eou__ Take care . __eou__
I think modern painting means nothing . __eou__ I think so too . It's just pointless . __eou__ Then why are so many crazy about it __eou__ I don't know.Maybe they are really crazy . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__
I heard you are going to move . __eou__ Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying . __eou__ What are you worried about ? __eou__ I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff . __eou__ You can call a mover . __eou__ How much dose that cost ? __eou__ Around 200 RIB for a truck . __eou__ I think it ’ s a little expensive . __eou__ But think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . I ’ ll leave you their phone number . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__ It ’ s 8357688 8 . __eou__ Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
I saw your car outside , so I stooped by . __eou__ Yeah , I come here every now and then . __eou__
I just meant that she's got different taste . __eou__ What kind of girl is she ? __eou__ She's pretty conservative . __eou__ Is her fiance Taiwanese ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How old is he ? __eou__ About 30 . He's really outgoing . But why do you ask ? __eou__
How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . __eou__ And how's everyone in your family ? __eou__ Very well , thank you . I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve.Would you care to join us ? __eou__ I'd love to , but I'm afraid I can't . __eou__
That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? __eou__ Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who aren ’ t too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her . __eou__ I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered . __eou__ He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . __eou__ Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? __eou__ I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . __eou__ We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls - probably because I ’ m so tall myself . __eou__ Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? __eou__ No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ? __eou__ Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . __eou__ I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . __eou__
Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? __eou__ Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? __eou__ No , thanks . __eou__ Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . __eou__ Thank you for your concern . __eou__

Um , which of them is the better typist ? __eou__ Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . __eou__ Is there any difference in their short hand ? __eou__ Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . __eou__ How about languages ? __eou__ Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . __eou__ Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . __eou__
Today is your birthday . First of all , happy birthday to you ! __eou__ Thank you for coming . We will have dinner outside . Eat up ! __eou__
Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? __eou__ No , nobody . __eou__ You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? __eou__ Well , to be frank , yes , I do . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , isn ’ t it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? __eou__ Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . __eou__ Sign ? What ’ s sign ? __eou__ There , on the window . __eou__ Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . __eou__ That ’ s all right . __eou__
I don't know whether or not to believe him . __eou__ You can trust him . He always tells the truth . __eou__ But it's really too important to me . __eou__ I said you can trust him . You just have to believe it . __eou__
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . __eou__
Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ Uh , yes . __eou__ Do you go to work by train every day . __eou__ Yes . I commute five days a week by train . __eou__ And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ? __eou__ It ’ s really very good . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Well , trains are frequent and come on time . __eou__ Which train do you catch in the evening ? __eou__ I usually take the five thirty home . __eou__ And can you get a seat ? __eou__ No , I usually have to stand . __eou__ Would you agree that the service is fast ? __eou__ Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up 25 present . __eou__
So , how'd everyone do ? __eou__ Well , there's this clock I was ... MY vintage clock ! How do you have my clock ? ? __eou__ Your vintage clock ? ! I just paid sixty-five dollars for it . __eou__ Sixty-five ? What the ... ? How did you bargain him down , Wei ? You've never even been to a flea market before ! __eou__ It must be my special touch . I think bargaining is in my blood ! __eou__ Never underestimate a woman when it comes to bargaining ! __eou__
You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I have been here for three years . __eou__ Do you like this campus ? __eou__ Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__ Oh . It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__ I ’ ll just have to put up with it . __eou__
Would you mind if I smoked ? __eou__ I'd rather you didn't . __eou__
How do you feel about the TV series ? __eou__ Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . __eou__ Yes , I agree , but still a lot of people watch it . __eou__ But I don't think much of it . __eou__
I've brought some potato chips . Would you like some , Jack ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to swap some of my peanuts for your chips . __eou__ That'll be fine . Thanks . __eou__ Do you have any ketchup ? __eou__ I forgot to bring it , but maybe Mary has some . Let's go and ask her . __eou__
Harry is a hen-pecked husband . __eou__ No , he isn ’ t . __eou__ Then why does he let himself be lead by the nose ? __eou__ He is afraid of his father-in-law . __eou__
Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ? __eou__ Do you mean lying to people for their good ? __eou__ Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ? __eou__ It's hard to say . I mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is . __eou__ But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth . __eou__ I know . If you're sure the truth will do harm , maybe you can choose not to tell it . __eou__
Hi , Julie . I was in your neighborhood and I'd like to drop by . __eou__ Come on in . Would you care for a drink ? __eou__ That sounds refreshing . Thanks ! __eou__
May , is the university a terrible place ? __eou__ Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ? __eou__ Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in . __eou__ Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think . __eou__ How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet . __eou__ Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom . __eou__ Oh , really ? Were you not caught ? __eou__ Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment . __eou__ What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ? __eou__ This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect . __eou__ I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English . __eou__ Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make . __eou__ You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form . __eou__ Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision . __eou__
Who is your favorite NBA star ? __eou__ Kobe Bryant , of course . __eou__ Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . __eou__ He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . __eou__ Maybe he is not good at rebounding ? __eou__ Indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . __eou__ Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? __eou__ Who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . __eou__ Well then , what are your spoils ? __eou__ Well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ I would like to find this book . __eou__ Is there a problem ? __eou__ I don ’ t think you guys have it . __eou__ You should look it up on our computer . __eou__ I did that . __eou__ What came up ? __eou__ It should be on the shelf , but I didn ’ t see it . __eou__ I can try to get the book from a different library . __eou__ I didn ’ t know you could do that . __eou__ I will call you when I find it . __eou__ I appreciate your help . __eou__
What happened ? __eou__ It was just a misunderstanding . __eou__
I hear little Bob has recovered . __eou__ That's a great relief . I was worried about him . __eou__ The operation was very successful . __eou__ His parents must feel very happy . __eou__
Are you in favor of having a trip during the spring break ? __eou__ This is just what I have in mind.Where are you planning to go ? __eou__ How about the Yellow Mountains ? __eou__ Good idea ! __eou__
Did you go to the movie yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ What did you think of it ? __eou__ I don't think much of the film . __eou__ I think it is the worst one I have ever seen . __eou__ Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . __eou__ I can't think the same . __eou__ What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you . __eou__
Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I ’ m looking forward to this party , but I didn ’ t want to go alone . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__ No , this is my first.Last week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home . I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one __eou__ Cookouts often start slowly . A two o ’ clock start means you arrive any time after two . __eou__ Thanks for telling me this . __eou__ I was late getting back from the mall , but I ’ m hurrying . __eou__ Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it ’ s only seven-fifteen . I don ’ t want to be the first one there again . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . We won ’ t be the first . __eou__
How did you do in the last quiz ? __eou__ I doubt if I can pass it . __eou__ Don't be so worried , You know Professor Robert is not too strict . __eou__ But I often skip his classes , and he doesn't like me . __eou__ I hope you'll do better in the final . __eou__ I must , if I want to pass the course . __eou__
I am so bored all day . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back . __eou__ Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . __eou__
Mike has changed much after marriage . __eou__ Yeah . He ’ s almost become a slave , his wife is leading him by the nose . __eou__ It ’ s unbelievable . He used to be such a rough guy . __eou__
Say , Anna , what are you doing tonight ? Would you like to go out ? __eou__ Oh , sorry , I can't . I'm going to work late tonight . I have to finish this report . __eou__ Well , how about tomorrow night ? Are you doing anything then ? __eou__ No , I'm not . What are you planning to do ? __eou__ I'm going to see a musical . Would you like to come ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to ! But let me pay for the tickets this time . It's my turn . __eou__ All right ! Thanks ! __eou__
Sorry , I overslept . My alarm clock didn't go off this morning . __eou__ Again ? __eou__ That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night . __eou__ Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one . __eou__ Well . If it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one . __eou__ Maybe by then it will be too late . __eou__ What do you mean too late ? __eou__ By that time , you will be fired . __eou__
Do you often go to watch sports games ? __eou__ I go occasionally when there's a game on near home , but usually I watch it on TV . __eou__ Can you recall the games ? __eou__ Sometimes . But I'll never forget the game in which our Chinese Women's Volleyball Team won the World Cup . It is the most thrilling and exciting game I have ever seen . __eou__
How do you like your work ? __eou__ The work is rather hard , but it's interesting . __eou__ What do you do ? __eou__ I work in a publishing house . How about you ? __eou__ Mine isn't hard , but it's not interesting . __eou__ What do you do then ? __eou__ I'm a clerk in a shop . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ I can ’ t find the book I want . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try looking at the database ? __eou__ I checked it already . __eou__ Do we have it available ? __eou__ It wasn ’ t there . __eou__ I guess it is lost . __eou__ Will you be getting another copy ? __eou__ Yes , we will . __eou__ Could you reserve a copy for me ? __eou__ I can do that . __eou__ That ’ s great . Thanks a lot . __eou__
Can you help me figure out how to use this vending machine ? __eou__ Yes , I would be happy to help . What do you want to buy ? __eou__ I want to buy that candy . __eou__ OK . So this machine will make change if you need it . Do you have your dollars ready ? __eou__ Yeah , so far , so good . __eou__ Next , you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot . Make sure they are smooth . __eou__ Yeah , I already knew that . __eou__ I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck , you might have to re-feed it . __eou__ OK , let's move on ! __eou__ Now you just make your selection and pray . If nothing comes out , try again or call the number on the side of the machine . __eou__ I hope it works ! __eou__ Well , good luck ! __eou__
What was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? __eou__ My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . __eou__ Three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! __eou__ Well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . __eou__ Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? __eou__ I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . __eou__ Did your husband's family get to meet your family ? __eou__ My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family . __eou__ That makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? __eou__ We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . __eou__ You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? __eou__ Not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! __eou__
Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . __eou__ Why would that be funny ? __eou__ Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . __eou__ I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . __eou__ What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . __eou__ Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . __eou__ What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . __eou__ Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , whatever . __eou__
How did your vacation go ? __eou__ I traveled the Three Gorges . __eou__ What about the trip ? Do you enjoy yourself ? __eou__ Yes , we had a good time . The trip was terrific . We toured the Three Gorges by boat . Its realty exciting ! __eou__ Did your boat float down the river ? __eou__ Yes . There are many places where the gorge is very narrow , with steep cliffs on both sides . __eou__ Sounds dangerous . __eou__ Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that . __eou__ What a thrilling trip ! __eou__
What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? __eou__ He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! __eou__ I don't think so . He only had no common sense . __eou__
They promised us a sea view . __eou__ Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . __eou__ Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . __eou__ Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . __eou__
Hello , Mike , long time no see . How's everything going ? __eou__ Not bad . Thank you . You look great today . And how is your husband ? __eou__ He caught a cold yesterday , but he feels much better now . __eou__ Well , I'm glad to hear that . Please give my regards to him . __eou__ I sure will . Thanks . __eou__
Hello ! How are you . __eou__ Not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor . I haven ’ t been feeling too well over the last few days . __eou__ What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ? __eou__ That ’ s the funny thing . I don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . I just feel exhausted . __eou__ Perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job . __eou__ Maybe . I haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either . That ’ s unusual . __eou__ Well . I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good . __eou__ Yes , he is . I ’ Ve make an appointment for 10 o ’ clock , so I ’ d better move along . __eou__ OK . Hope you feel better soon . You should take it easy . I ’ m sure the doctor will prescribe rest , you know . __eou__
If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . __eou__ Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China . __eou__ Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it . __eou__ Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms . __eou__ Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . __eou__

Let ’ s call it a day . __eou__ It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But it ’ s the evening rush . __eou__ It ’ s hard to commute a long way . __eou__ Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam . __eou__

What was the movie you saw last night ? __eou__ It was a foreign film called ' Gone with the wind ' . __eou__ Really ? I've seen that movie , too . __eou__ How did you like the movie ? __eou__ I thought it was pretty good . __eou__ I can't say I agree . __eou__ You're kidding . The storyline and acting were outstanding . __eou__ I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . __eou__ It might be . __eou__
Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or - treating ? __eou__ What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? __eou__ Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . __eou__ Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! __eou__
I hear Yolanda has been studying every night this week for the exam . __eou__ That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week . __eou__

How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ? __eou__ Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__ You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? __eou__ Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . __eou__ Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . __eou__
Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ? __eou__ I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? __eou__ Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . __eou__ What did it say about you then ? __eou__ For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee . __eou__ But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science . __eou__ Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it . __eou__ For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their " accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . __eou__
Don't have some relation with him . You know , he is not a kind man . __eou__ Yeah . Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior . __eou__ If you attack him , be sure you ’ ll get a Roland for an Oliver . __eou__ OK , it ’ s better to be far away from him . __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout . __eou__ I ’ m not crazy about it at all . __eou__ You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? __eou__ I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . __eou__ I hate it . __eou__ Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . __eou__ It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . __eou__
Hi , Jenny . Are you going to school now ? __eou__ Yup . I have English at 9 in the morning . __eou__ Got any plans after the class ? __eou__ Not really . What about you ? __eou__ We will have our midterm exams next month . I plan to look for some important books and study at the library . Do you want to join me ? __eou__ Sure . I need to return some books . They are due today . Besides , I can also read some weekly publications , magazines and newspapers . __eou__ Great . We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . We can chill out a little in such a hot summer . Are you good at swimming ? __eou__ Well , that's a good question . I haven't swum for almost two years . I think I need more practice . __eou__ Oh , it's almost 9 . I need to hurry . I am running late now . See you after class in front of the library then . Bye ! __eou__ See you then . __eou__
Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? __eou__ No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . __eou__ You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . __eou__ I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . __eou__ So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet . __eou__
Did you listen to the weather forecast ? __eou__ No . Why ? __eou__ There's a typhoon coming . __eou__ No way ! __eou__ Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . __eou__
... I knew it . I always knew you were a lesbian ! __eou__ She's my roommate , not my date . The D-man , as in dork . __eou__ Haha . Still got that great sense of humor , I see . Here's my card . I sell used cars . A car from us is a car you can trust ! __eou__ Alrighty then . Didn't you use to date Sheryl ? __eou__ Sweet little lassie . Yep , broke her heart when the D-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy . __eou__ Oh ? I heard she dumped you . Anyway , she's right over there . Oh , Sheryl ! __eou__
Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ? __eou__ I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions . __eou__ No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows . __eou__ It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell . __eou__ Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . __eou__ I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . __eou__ That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals . __eou__ Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters . __eou__
The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . __eou__ Because it was her husband who beat her . __eou__ It is incredible . __eou__ She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . __eou__ You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . __eou__
I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? __eou__ He appeals to the fans thanks to two things __eou__ you mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . __eou__ Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k __eou__ In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . __eou__ yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . __eou__ and he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . __eou__
What are you reading ? You've had your nose buried in that book since last night . __eou__ This book is so good . I just can't put it down ! It's called ' The Power of One ' . __eou__ I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember . __eou__ Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in ! __eou__ Can I read it when you're finished ? __eou__ Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping . __eou__ Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself . __eou__ Okay . But be prepared for an all-nighter ! I doubt you will want to put it down either . __eou__
Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? __eou__ No . I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? __eou__ Yeah . I worked about 20 hours a week in a pizza restaurant . __eou__ What was that like ? __eou__ It was always very busy there . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . __eou__ Did you get any perks on the job ? __eou__ Yeah . I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . __eou__
May I introduce myself ? I am steven smith . __eou__ Glad to meet you mr smith my name is jenny . __eou__

That looks like an interesting book . __eou__ It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . __eou__ There are the pyramids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . __eou__ They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the united states . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . __eou__ Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . __eou__ Yes . Usually only TV towers are cylindrical in shape . __eou__ TV towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . __eou__ This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval . __eou__ What sports do they play there ? __eou__ It says here that it ’ s m mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . __eou__ Is that building a perfect cube ? __eou__ According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What __eou__ Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . __eou__
Hey Bobby . What's going on ? __eou__ Just taking a smoke break . __eou__ I forgot my cigarette today . Do you have another one ? __eou__ Sure . Here you go . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ I didn't know you smoked . __eou__ Really ? I've been smoking for over a year now . __eou__ Oh . You're new to smoking still . I've been smoking for 7 years . __eou__ You ever tried to quit ? __eou__ Many times . I'm really addicted . It's harder to stop than you think . __eou__ Yeah . I tried to quit last month , and I thought it was going to be easy , but it turns out that I'm still smoking . __eou__ I highly recommend you quit soon .

I'll talk to you later . __eou__

What did you do last night ? __eou__ I just stayed at home and watched TV . __eou__ Did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? __eou__ Yes , it was a very evenly matched game . __eou__ What were the results of the game ? __eou__ It ended in a tie . __eou__ What was the actual score ? __eou__ It was three all . __eou__ Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . __eou__ If Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . __eou__ That explains it . __eou__ How many more games are left this season ? __eou__ That was the last game before the playoffs . __eou__ When do the playoffs start ? __eou__ In a few weeks .

Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__ Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__ Do you mean financially rewarding ? __eou__ Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . __eou__ I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . __eou__ Sometimes that's true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . __eou__ How much do you make ? __eou__ I'm a GS - 15 . That's high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . __eou__
I just got fired . __eou__ You asked for it . __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi , Kathy . Have you had lunch ? __eou__ Not yet . And I ’ m really hungry now . __eou__ I ’ m starving , too . There is a new Chinese restaurant close by . Do you want to go there for lunch ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ It ’ s my treat this time . __eou__ Thanks . I could eat a cow . __eou__
Would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things . __eou__ But they ’ re very nice , you know . __eou__ Really . __eou__ And not expensive either . __eou__ Oh , I don ’ t care about that . __eou__ Everybody is buying them . __eou__ Are they ? __eou__ Yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see . __eou__ I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion . __eou__ I see . __eou__ But thank you very much all the same . __eou__ Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you . __eou__
Hi . What's up ? __eou__ Nothing much . What's new with you ? __eou__ Not too much . I've been pretty busy . __eou__ Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . __eou__ Gotta go . Call me tonight . __eou__ Okay . Check you later . __eou__
Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ? __eou__ Gatorade . It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . One for each . __eou__ What should we do , now with Jack out of the game ? __eou__ We should choose from the backups . __eou__ That ’ s right . Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match . __eou__ That ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . Otherwise , the game is not worth the candle . __eou__ That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played . __eou__ Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ? __eou__ I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before . __eou__ Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic . __eou__ Yeah , look how passionate they are ! Are they professional ? __eou__ Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding . __eou__ Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ? __eou__ Yeah , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ? __eou__ I also have a doubt . Oh , kill me softly , she is May . __eou__
Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . __eou__ Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! __eou__ Thank you , shall I open it now ? __eou__ Yes , please do . __eou__ Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . __eou__ Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__ Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . __eou__
Hi , Mark ! Long time no see ! __eou__ Hi , Alex ! __eou__ Where have you been ? __eou__ I just got back from London . __eou__ How was your flight ? __eou__ It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . How long was the flight ? __eou__ It was 10 hours . __eou__ Did you have a layover ? __eou__ Yes , in Paris , France . __eou__ Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? __eou__ Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you ! __eou__ Oh , you didn ’ t have to ... __eou__ It was nothing . __eou__
I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them . __eou__ Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround . __eou__ Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . __eou__ Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies . __eou__ With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board . __eou__ Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people . __eou__ Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people . __eou__
Do you have a bf ? __eou__ Yes , I had a bf before . __eou__ Why you say bf before ? __eou__ We parted from each other last month . __eou__ Have you got a new one ? __eou__ Mmmm , no . How about you ? __eou__ I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you . __eou__ Haha , so you are my E-bf . __eou__ I like you . Do you agree to be my of ? __eou__ Mmmm . .. OK , let's try to be . __eou__ Wow ! Blablablabla . . . __eou__ Hey ! What is it ? __eou__ I am flying like a bird . __eou__ LL __eou__ I am so happy . I want to drink a cup of champagne . __eou__ I have no champagne right now . How about this ? __eou__ It's OK , so I send you this . __eou__ Is it made of chocolate ? __eou__ It's my heart ; it's made of what you like . __eou__ Oh , I will have a sweet dream . __eou__ Are you sleepy ? __eou__ A little bit . I have to go to sleep though I don't want to . __eou__ Yes , I do not want to see ur sleeping in the office . __eou__ Thx.Bye for now . Kisssssssssss . __eou__ C U here , honey . __eou__
Hello , Kevin . __eou__ Oh , hi , Lee . You look great . __eou__ Thanks . You too . __eou__
What's the weather forecast for today ? __eou__ Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . __eou__ Any rain ? __eou__ No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . __eou__ I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . __eou__
Which do you like better , orange or lemon ? __eou__ I like orange better . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because orange is much more to my taste . __eou__
You hurt Ben's feelings . __eou__ So ? __eou__
have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? __eou__ no . what's it like ? __eou__ it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through __eou__ would you want to live there ? __eou__ I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro __eou__ what's your dreamhole like then ? __eou__ my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England . __eou__ would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? __eou__ old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . __eou__ it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ? __eou__ no , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! __eou__ I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? __eou__ no , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a __eou__
When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . __eou__ It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . __eou__ I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . __eou__
You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? __eou__ Yes , I finished last Friday . __eou__ You sound relieved . __eou__ Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am .

What are we having ? __eou__ I made strawberry shortcake . __eou__ Ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice . __eou__ Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? __eou__ I'll have a cup of tea . __eou__ Do you take cream or sugar with your tea ? __eou__ Actually , could I have some milk with that ? __eou__ Definitely . Would you like skim or whole milk ? __eou__ Skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . I need to go pick her up . __eou__ I'll go with you . Where is she ? __eou__ She's on the M40 , near Reading . __eou__ Is she alright ? __eou__ I don't know , she didn't say . I'm so sorry about this . __eou__ Don't worry . Family comes first . Come on , let's go . __eou__ Actually , I've only got a two-seater . I'll have to go on my own . __eou__ Ok . Just call me if you need anything then . __eou__ I will . Thanks a lot . __eou__

Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? __eou__ There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . __eou__ Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . __eou__ Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food . __eou__ What is the international community doing to help ? __eou__ The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region . __eou__ How many countries have been affected ? __eou__ Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries . __eou__ I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran . __eou__ Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble . __eou__ Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? __eou__ So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . __eou__
Where are you going for your trip ? __eou__ I think Hebes is a good place . __eou__ But I heard the north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , it's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds . __eou__ How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas ? __eou__ The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms . The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation . __eou__ It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody ! __eou__ You are quite right . __eou__
hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ everything's great . And you ? __eou__ same here . Have you seen any new films recently ? __eou__ no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce . __eou__ oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . __eou__ yeah . I found it is so close to our life . __eou__ it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__ you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years . __eou__ well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too . __eou__ I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__ oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__ that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation . __eou__ I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage . __eou__ definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__ in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__ I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . __eou__
We should keep Frank at arm's length . __eou__ Yeah . He's known as a sly dog . He's done many people in . __eou__ He hits below the belt . __eou__ And he may cash in on people whenever chances are provided . __eou__
Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . __eou__ I don't think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . __eou__ Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes would do no good . __eou__ No.You can't suddenly make smoking illegal . But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters . __eou__

I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ? __eou__ Honey , we're in the museum now . We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso ! __eou__ I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man ! __eou__ You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting . __eou__ Are you serious , John ? __eou__ All I'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting . __eou__
Don ’ t you think it would be an idea to name the ship Dolphin ? __eou__ All right , if that would make you happy . __eou__ So you ’ Ve got something on your mind , I guess . __eou__ Well , nothing really serious . __eou__

I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements.You have one botany class and one chemistry class . And political science.So that's nine credits . Did you take English Composition 201 ? __eou__ No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition . __eou__ Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet . __eou__ No , I thought I would take it later . __eou__ Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later . __eou__ Well , I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class . I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets . __eou__ Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11 __eou__ I can take it then . I have that time slot free . __eou__ Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher . __eou__ I'll take it then . __eou__ Tell me , Lisa , what made you decide to be an English major ? __eou__ I want to be an English professor in the future . I love studying literature , and I want to teach it . __eou__ Really ? That's great to know . __eou__ That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible . __eou__
hey , Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? __eou__ it was wonderful , but I was so tired . __eou__ did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ? __eou__ yes , that was the first thing we did .

However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening . __eou__ yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you . __eou__ on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems . __eou__ that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . __eou__ you'll have to try for yourself some day . __eou__
Excuse me . __eou__ Yes , Miss , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I ordered my dish about a half an hour ago , but it hasn't arrived yet . __eou__ I'm sorry for that , I'm going to check with the chef right now .

But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . __eou__ I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments.It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ? __eou__ Yes . And what dances do you do best ? __eou__ Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance . __eou__ Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ Fine . __eou__
What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? __eou__ We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River . __eou__ How hard is the climb ? __eou__ It is a very difficult climb , because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . __eou__ What did you do last week ? __eou__ We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting . __eou__ Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it . __eou__ Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . __eou__ Yeah , I will .

While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year . __eou__ That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time . __eou__ I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English . __eou__ 800 books ? I'm impressed ! __eou__ My aunts studied in the American universities.They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English.That ' s what they learn here in America . __eou__

We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . __eou__ For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? __eou__ Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . __eou__ What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? __eou__ Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . __eou__ Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! __eou__ We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . __eou__ We ’ re doomed ! __eou__ There is some really good news though ! __eou__ Really ? What ! __eou__ I got offered a new job ! __eou__

I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . __eou__ Did you finish typing it yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . __eou__ Don't worry about it .

Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . __eou__ He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . __eou__ Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . __eou__ Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . __eou__ That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . __eou__ Why doesn't he just drive to work ? __eou__ It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . __eou__
What can I do ? __eou__ Take the books out of the bookcase . Put them in this box . __eou__ Well , the books are in the box . What can I do now ? __eou__ Take the magazines out of the bookcase . Put them in that box . __eou__ All right . __eou__ Peter ! Pack them . Don't read them . __eou__ These magazines are interesting . May I borrow one ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Thanks , John . __eou__
This is great , isn't it ? __eou__ It's the most fun I've had in years . __eou__ We should do this more often . __eou__ Yes , we should . __eou__
What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? __eou__ He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! __eou__ I don't think so . He only had no common sense . __eou__
Have we sold out all the newspapers for today ? __eou__ Yes . What a good job we have done ! __eou__ Why are so many extra gifts left here ? __eou__ Many customers didn't want them . __eou__ How about giving them to that old man ? __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ By the way , do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today . __eou__ I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper . __eou__ But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around . __eou__ That's true . __eou__ Anyway , let's just finish out job and get back home . __eou__ Okay . How tiring the job is ! __eou__
I'm afraid of the darkness . __eou__ Don't worry . I'll drive you back . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
What's your number ? __eou__ I'm number seven . What about you ? __eou__ Five . __eou__ Hah hah ! You have to go before me . __eou__ You think it's funny . I'm terrified . __eou__ Don't worry . It's safe . __eou__ But I've never jumped off anything in my life . The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed . I'm scared . __eou__ You are the one who wanted to come here , Sandy . You should enjoy it . __eou__ I guess I'm adventuresome , but then I'm scared too . __eou__ I'm not too scared . But I've done sky diving before . __eou__
I think modern painting means nothing . __eou__ I think so too . It's just pointless . __eou__ Then why are so many guys so crazy about it ? __eou__ I don't know . Maybe they're really crazy . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__
Hi ! Dick . Where are you going ? You're in such a hurry . __eou__ Playground . We're having sports for today's outside class activities . All my classmates have already got there . __eou__ What are you going to play ? __eou__ Some of us will play basketball and some volleyball . __eou__ Enjoy yourself . __eou__
Yesterday I had a deal with a vice manager . He acts like the point man . __eou__ I always meet people like him . __eou__
Wow , the view from the peak is so grand ! __eou__ Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red . __eou__ Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ? __eou__ Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child . __eou__ But my father did not . He didn't have much time . __eou__ Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent . __eou__ Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ? __eou__ Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time . __eou__ It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ? __eou__ Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty . __eou__ Can I see the rainbow ? __eou__ That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks . __eou__
Tom has grown six inches within a year . __eou__ He has reached puberty . His mind and body both will change a lot . __eou__ Yeah , do you see his Adam's apple ? It becomes bigger . __eou__ Time is flying . I still remember everything when he was a child . __eou__
For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ? __eou__ Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? __eou__ I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . __eou__ Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? __eou__ Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . __eou__ That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? __eou__ As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay . __eou__ With your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian . __eou__ We can make some special arrangement if we need to . After all , it's the company who is footing the bill . __eou__
Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . __eou__ But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . __eou__ I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? __eou__ I don't care . __eou__
Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ? __eou__ Certainly , where will you be coming from ? __eou__ I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there . __eou__ Ok . Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington . Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit . __eou__ Got that . __eou__ Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right . __eou__ Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ? __eou__ No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right . __eou__ Ok , I can see that road . __eou__ That's fine . You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library . __eou__ Good , I can see the library on the map . __eou__ Ok , we live in the third building on your left . Will we see you around 7 pm ? __eou__ That's great , see you at seven . __eou__
Guess what came in the mail today ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ My acceptance letter to Yale ! __eou__ Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ? __eou__ Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in . __eou__ You ’ re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes . __eou__ When can you do that ? __eou__ Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ? __eou__ Sure . What can you choose from ? __eou__ Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major . __eou__ What is your major ? __eou__ I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see . __eou__ What are the fundamental course ? __eou__ In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art . __eou__ Interesting . That ’ s very different from the Chinese education system . __eou__ Yes , it is . It ’ s also very different from the British education system . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ oh , sure . In British , students don ’ t have to take the foundation course . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha . __eou__
Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . __eou__ What position do you play ? __eou__ I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? Which team ? __eou__ The Rockets . __eou__ Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later . __eou__ All right , see you later . __eou__

Excuse me . Is there any body here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I've finished up all my water . I would kill for a sip of water . __eou__ Sure , come on in . __eou__ Thank you very much . Are you here alone ? __eou__ My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ? __eou__ I'm a back-packer from America . __eou__ What is a back-packer ? __eou__ It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world . __eou__ Cool . You must have been to a lot of places . __eou__ Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places . __eou__ So cool . I want to be a back-packer when I grow up . __eou__ You can do it . But do work hard on your English to make it easier . __eou__ I'll try my best . __eou__
OK , Dead Man . If this doesn't start your engine , nothing will . __eou__ Thank you . Hey , do you know how espresso got its name ? __eou__ No , I don't . __eou__ It's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee . Es-PRESS-o , get it ? __eou__ Uh , are you sure about that ? I thought espresso was an Italian word . __eou__
Hello ! __eou__ Oh , hi ! __eou__ Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom . __eou__ Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ? __eou__ Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ? __eou__ Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ? __eou__ No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ? __eou__ I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ? __eou__ I am an accountant at a company __eou__ Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college . __eou__ It's nice meeting you too , Alice . __eou__ See you around ! __eou__ Goodbye , Alice . __eou__
Good morning , Mei ! How are you ? __eou__ Hi Tom ! I'm fine , and you ? __eou__ Not bad thanks . __eou__ Good . See you ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
You like movies ? __eou__ Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax . __eou__ What type do you like the best ? __eou__ Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything . __eou__ I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . __eou__ Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . __eou__ True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade . __eou__ Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time . __eou__ I'm totally with you on that . __eou__
What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . __eou__ Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ? __eou__ Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to buy one today . __eou__
Hey , your Chinese is coming along ! __eou__ You think ? __eou__ Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . __eou__ But I still get stuck on the different tones.It drives me crazy . __eou__ Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . __eou__
I can ’ t wait to retire . __eou__ And then what ? __eou__ And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day ! __eou__ That sounds boring to me . __eou__ What do you plan on doing after you retire ? __eou__ Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . I ’ m willing to begin studying to teach . __eou__ I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . __eou__
What colour is her hair ? __eou__ Oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ... __eou__ What , curly ? __eou__ No , not at all . Very straight . Her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears . __eou__ Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ No ... no . I think you're thinking of someone else . __eou__ No . I'm sure I know her . __eou__ Er ... what else can I tell you ? Er ... she's got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth . __eou__ Ah ... No , I can't place her . __eou__
Charles , do you have any children ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How many children do you have ? __eou__ I have two kids . A boy and a girl . __eou__ What are their names ? __eou__ Jack and Stephanie . __eou__ How old are they ? __eou__ Stephanie is 18 and Jack is 24 . __eou__ Are they in school ? __eou__ Stephanie is . She goes to college in Washington and Jack works in Florida . __eou__ What does Stephanie study ? __eou__ She studies English . __eou__ Is she here now ? __eou__ No , she's at school . __eou__
I can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding . __eou__ Yes . It's perfect . __eou__ And all of the flowers are in bloom . __eou__ I couldn't have asked for more . __eou__
I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher . __eou__ Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked ? __eou__ I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right . __eou__ These things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure , all right ? __eou__ That would be great ! __eou__ Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers . Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading ? __eou__ This one right here should be right . __eou__ Yeah , I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that , right ? __eou__ Yeah , let's do the math . __eou__ I count all of the correct answers , total them , and divide by the total . Does this look right to you ? __eou__ Looks pretty good . __eou__ Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores ; keep studying ! __eou__
Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time . __eou__ I have a part-time job now , so I work in the evenings . __eou__ That explains it . __eou__
Mrs . Schmidt ! What's happening ! __eou__ You'll never guess what happened today ! I went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ... __eou__ And the doctor told you to start listening to Bach ? __eou__ No ... He told me I'm pregnant ! __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ And so I bought all these books on having kids and ... __eou__ And they said you should play classical music ? __eou__ How did you know ! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter ! __eou__
Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ How many planets are there in the solar system ? __eou__ That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nine . __eou__ Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! __eou__ Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . __eou__ I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . __eou__ That sounds crazy . But they can't just change their mind about things like that . __eou__ Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . __eou__ I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . __eou__ We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . __eou__ Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? __eou__ I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . __eou__ Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? __eou__ I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth . __eou__ You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! __eou__ Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . __eou__
You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? __eou__ Yes , I finished last Friday . __eou__ You sound relieved . __eou__ Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . __eou__ Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? __eou__ Yes , I intend to go to university . That'll be in September . But it all depends on my A level results . __eou__ You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? __eou__ Oh , yes . __eou__
I noticed your absence in class this morning . __eou__ I'm sorry , I overslept . __eou__
Hello , Jack here . __eou__ Hello , Jack . It's Mary . What are you doing in your office ? __eou__ I am working . I often work late on Thursdays . I am busy this week . __eou__ Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday ? __eou__ Tomorrow ? No , I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to . I'm going out of the town on business . __eou__ What about Saturday ? __eou__ Sorry , I never go out on Saturday evening . I always watch football on Saturday evening . __eou__ Will you come round next Tuesday ? __eou__ Next Tuesday ? Just a moment ! It will be the 21st of May . Oh , dear . Arm ... I promised my aunt I would be at her birthday party . __eou__ What do you say to next Wednesday then ? __eou__ Let me see . Yes , Mary . Let's make it next Wednesday . __eou__ Ok . Bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
It's snowing outside . __eou__ Oh , how could it be ? __eou__ Let's go out and have a look . __eou__ OK . Wait a minute . __eou__ Look at the snow , it's so beautiful . __eou__ Yes . It's really snowing . __eou__ I love winter , I love snow . __eou__ But don't you think it's a little too cold ? __eou__ But I like cold more than hot . __eou__ You are so interesting . __eou__
How often do you have English lessons ? __eou__ I have a lesson once a week but I try to practice every day . __eou__ How do you practice ? __eou__ I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week . __eou__ Do you ever speak to native speakers of English ? __eou__ Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends . __eou__
What happened to that girl you were seeing ? __eou__ Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . __eou__ That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . __eou__ It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . __eou__ She sounds very emotional . __eou__ She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . __eou__ Were you suppose to be there ? __eou__ I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . __eou__ Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . __eou__ I'm just glad it's over . __eou__
Adam . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late . __eou__ Yes , But I couldn ’ t help it . I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus . The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . It was one thing after another . __eou__ why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters . __eou__ Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ? __eou__ Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Well . You ’ re here . __eou__
How was the movie last night ? __eou__ I didn't really like it . __eou__ Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . __eou__ I found it very disappointing . __eou__ She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . __eou__ I wasn't happy with it . __eou__ Nothing is to your satisfaction . __eou__
I'm busy year in and year out , but now I've done nothing . __eou__ You've done a lot , my darling ! __eou__ I may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction . __eou__ You're too strict with yourself . __eou__ Perhaps . I'm dead tired . __eou__
Would you like to come to our party ? __eou__ I'd like to . But I'm not myself today . __eou__ What happened ? You look so pale . __eou__ It's the end of the world for me . __eou__ What makes you say that ? __eou__ Today , I'm told I failed three courses . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . Work harder next term . __eou__ B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me . __eou__ Don't lose heart . Everything will be fine . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
What do you think of the lawyer's speech ? __eou__ He has a glib tongue . Few people can argue him down . __eou__ Don't believe him . He's liar . __eou__ We cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth . __eou__
hey , the new SOHO . How's everything going ? __eou__ everything's great . I've just returned from my office . __eou__ your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ? __eou__ sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area . __eou__ a virtual office ? __eou__ yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building . __eou__ what kind of services do they offer ? __eou__ a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office . __eou__ sounds fun.what else ? __eou__ I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor . __eou__ oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image . __eou__ you bet it ! __eou__
I just love your hair that way . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Where did you have it done ? __eou__ My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? __eou__ Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . __eou__ Well , it looks very nice . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
That was a great party . Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up . __eou__ It certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . __eou__ I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? __eou__ I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . __eou__ I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . __eou__ Afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . __eou__ Yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . __eou__ Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being very serious . __eou__ I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . __eou__ What did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . __eou__ That ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks that I prepared ? __eou__ Very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . __eou__ That cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? __eou__ All cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up ? __eou__
Mom , this is your third bowl of rice ! __eou__ I know but I have no choice . My stomach just keeps crying for more and more . __eou__ Why ? I never saw you eat so much before . __eou__ I've been going to the gym these days . The exercise makes me hungry all the time . __eou__ So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out . __eou__ Don't pull my leg . __eou__ This way you'll probably put on more weight . Will you give up ? __eou__ Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now . __eou__ Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ? __eou__ I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed . __eou__ Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise . __eou__ Your father is a bit too timid . He even doesn't know how to introduce himself . __eou__ He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy . __eou__ Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato . __eou__ Who knows ! __eou__
Look , Bob . This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia . __eou__ Let me see it , can I ? This is a good photograph . Who are these people ? __eou__ They ’ re people I met during the trip . That ’ s the ship we traveled on . __eou__ What a beautiful ship ! Who ’ s this ? __eou__ That ’ s the man I told you about . Remember ? __eou__ Ah yes . The one who offered you a job in Australia . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ Who ’ s this ? __eou__ Guess ! __eou__ It ’ s not you , is it ? __eou__ That ’ s right . I grew a beard during the trip , but I shaved it off when I came home . __eou__ Why did you shave it off ? __eou__ My wife didn ’ t like it ! __eou__
Hey , Jack ! Is Jenny coming with us ? __eou__ Yes . Why ? __eou__ Nothing . I am just asking . __eou__ Just asking ? ! Why is your face burning like mad ? Ah-huh , someone has a crush on Jenny , doesn't he ? __eou__ Who has a crush ? __eou__ Come on , Ted ! Don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you ’ Ve got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . __eou__ Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out . __eou__ What are you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you are feeling about her . __eou__ I ’ d totally die if she turned me down . __eou__ But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You ’ Ve got to let her know . Come on ! You ’ Ve got to take a chance . Even though you are rejected , it ’ s not the end of the world . There ’ s nothing to lose , is there ? __eou__ I don't know .. Well , maybe you are right , but how am I gonna tell her ? __eou__
Susan has got the cancer of stomach . __eou__ How terrible ! This is quite unexpected ! __eou__ Yesterday when I went to hospital to see her , you cannot imagine how greatly surprised when I saw her . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Because of atomic cocktail and other medicines , all of them have the side effect . she has lost all her hair . __eou__
Shall I punch out for you , Ross ? I am leaving now . __eou__ No , thanks . I have got to work overtime . __eou__ But today is Friday . You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening , are you ? __eou__ Well , I am . I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting . Is Tom coming to pick you up ? __eou__ No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa . __eou__ That's nice . Where is his villa ? __eou__ It's not his villa , but his father's . I think it's somewhere in Florida . I am not sure myself . __eou__ Sometimes I envy you a lot . Tom is a good guy . __eou__ Come on . You just haven ’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much . You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life . __eou__ I know , but I am a work maniac . __eou__ Well , suit yourself . I've got to run now . __eou__ Have a nice weekend . __eou__ You too . Oh , I forgot to tell you one thing . A girl called this afternoon . She said she was your ex-girlfriend . She wanted you to call her back . __eou__ Did she mention anything else ? __eou__ No , nothing else . See you Monday . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Are we going to have gym class tomorrow ? __eou__ Are you crazy ? Tomorrow's Saturday . __eou__ Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays . __eou__ Americans also don't go to work on Saturdays . __eou__ So there are only five working days in a week ? __eou__ Right . What are you going to do tonight ? __eou__ I'm going to study . __eou__ On a Friday night ? __eou__ Well , I need to polish up my English . __eou__
Thanks a million . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? __eou__ That depends . What does she look like ? __eou__ Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . __eou__ How tall is she ? __eou__ She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . __eou__ Is she chubby ? __eou__ Not at all . She's actually very athletic . __eou__ It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ No , but she does wear contact lenses . __eou__ How's her skin ? __eou__ She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . __eou__ Does she have any piercings or tattoos ? __eou__ I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos , one on her lower back , one on her neck , and one on her left foot . __eou__ What's the tattoo on her foot like ? __eou__ It's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one . __eou__ Even her mother ? __eou__ Yes , even her mother . __eou__ What's her personality like ? __eou__ She's a lot like me . __eou__ So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true ! __eou__
Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? __eou__ Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . __eou__ Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? __eou__ Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! __eou__ I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want . __eou__ Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ? __eou__ Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . __eou__ Cool ! Teach me ! __eou__ For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost . __eou__ Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else . __eou__ That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market . __eou__
I ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! I feel just awful about this whole thing . I wanna make it up to you . Let me take you out to dinner tonight . My treat . __eou__ That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address . Pick me up at eight ? __eou__ Perfect ! __eou__ Thank you for such a lovely evening ! The food was amazing , and I had a great time . __eou__ Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ... __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . __eou__
Hey , you ’ re early ! Where ’ s everyone ? __eou__ Well ... I told them not to come . I made a reservation just for the two of us . I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves . __eou__ Oh ... why ? __eou__ Jennifer , there ’ s something I wanna ask you . __eou__ Sure . What is it ? __eou__ Hmm ... okay , here ’ s the thing . I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ’ t take it any more . I know you better than anyone , I know the pros and cons of your personality , I even know what side of the bed is yours ! I think we would be great together , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Are you serious ? We ’ Ve been friends for years ! We can ’ t just change that overnight ! __eou__ I know ! I never had the guts to tell you ... until today . So , what do you say ? Are you willing to give me a shot ? __eou__ I ... I ... __eou__
How do you usually spend your time , now that you ’ Ve retired ? __eou__ Well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer than in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . __eou__ What do you have for breakfast ? __eou__ I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast . __eou__ that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? __eou__ I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 20 minutes to drive there . __eou__ How do you spend your afternoons ? __eou__ I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time . __eou__
What do you think of being a secretary ? __eou__ I'm not at all keen on that sort of job.It makes me crazy . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ You have to type all day . __eou__
Hey . Steven . You have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ? __eou__ I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company . And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it . __eou__ But I found you always hate to part with your money . Look at the car you drive ; it's such a junker ! __eou__ Oh , the car is old but still in good condition . I just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not . __eou__ But ... But ... __eou__ But what ? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue , but also a great revenue . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
Judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ? __eou__ Oh , yeah . The total amount is no less than 13,000 RIB , according to our itinerary . __eou__ What ? That's too much . __eou__ Sit down . I'll show you the list of our financial budget . First of all , it is nearly 4,000 RIB that we should spend in transportation . __eou__ Ah , the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget . __eou__ Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good . __eou__ Hmm , what I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel . __eou__ In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic . __eou__
Julia , what do you think of the network ? __eou__ Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . Internet makes our lives easier . But it's a two-blade sword . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc . __eou__ I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . But we have to know how to make good use of it . __eou__
I'm tired . __eou__ Well , you've been working on this assignment for five hours . __eou__ Yeah , I need to take a break . __eou__
Where are you going ? __eou__ I'll accompany my wife to the hospital . __eou__ What's wrong with her . __eou__ She is expecting . __eou__ Congratulations to you . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

What ’ s the name ? __eou__
Have you figured out where you want to transfer to ? __eou__ I can ’ t think of where to go . __eou__ Where would you like to go to school ? __eou__ I really don ’ t know . __eou__ You can ’ t think of anything ? __eou__ I really like where I ’ m at now . __eou__ So , why don ’ t you just stay here ? __eou__ That may be what I ’ m going to do . __eou__ It ’ s a perfectly good school . __eou__ You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__ Do you know what you ’ re going to do now ? __eou__ I ’ m just going to stay at PCC . __eou__
Those guys thought they would never lose . But we finally beat them . And look at them crying now . __eou__ The bigger they are , the harder they fall . __eou__
I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . __eou__ Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? __eou__ Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . __eou__ I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York . __eou__ Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . __eou__ Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . __eou__
You see that chick over there ? __eou__ The one in the red shirt ? __eou__ Yeah . Isn't she hot ? __eou__ She's alright . __eou__ Just alright ? ! ? She's hot ! __eou__ Why don't you go talk to her ? __eou__ You think she's out of my league ? __eou__ Hell no ! You're just a chicken that's all . __eou__ C'mon . I get nervous when I talk to girls . __eou__ Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up , strike a conversation . __eou__ What do I talk about ? __eou__ It doesn't matter . You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that . __eou__ I don't know ... __eou__ Do you want me to go talk to her ? __eou__ No . Stay away from her . __eou__ If you don't do anything , I'll bet somebody else will . __eou__ Ok already . I'll try . __eou__
How about a movie tonight ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t matter to me . __eou__ Does 7 o'clock suit you ? __eou__ Either way . I don ’ t care . __eou__ How about a snack after work ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t careless . __eou__ Would you rather stay home ? __eou__ Whatever you say . __eou__ Are you really interested in doing something ? __eou__ I don ’ t mind if you want to . __eou__
Have you ever played Making ? __eou__ Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . __eou__ Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . __eou__ Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . __eou__ It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . __eou__
Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__ Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__ Do you mean financially rewarding ? __eou__ Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . __eou__ I ’ Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . __eou__ Sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . __eou__ How much do you make ? __eou__ I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . __eou__
Do you have any idea for this vacation ? __eou__ Why don't we spend this vacation earning our tuition ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , let's try to find some jobs . __eou__ OK . __eou__

I am impressed with how smart and humorous . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s love at first sight . __eou__
So click here , then up to the top . __eou__ Er ... Hum ... Got it . __eou__ Then open that window.Yeah , that one . __eou__ Right ! __eou__ And that's it . You're done . __eou__ I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all . __eou__
Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . __eou__ I'm looking for it , but you see , the market shard for jobs , too . __eou__ You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . __eou__
